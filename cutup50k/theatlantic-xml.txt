Would the party keep heading rightward, judging that their main mistake was choosing a RINO as the nominee? Would head the other way, in an attempt to pick up support among Latinos, young people, women, etc? Sam Popkin went into <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/ask-dr-popkin-the-3-myths-of-the-romney-campaign/264532/">similar questions today</a>, explaining why he thinks a civil war has already broken out within the GOP.<br /><br />Now, two very different replies from two people whose main similarity is that they are business owners. <br /><br /><b>What if Obama wins? Atlas will shrug</b>. From a person whose geographical location (or, in fact, anything else about him) I don't know:<br /><blockquote>I will tell you what happens, I close my business of 10 years and lay off my employees. I am done. Thats what happens. You might consider me one of those know nothings but I am highly educated, run a high technology company with several very high paying positions and am very much steeped in US History and am a stalwart in the notion of individual liberty and self reliance.  Freedom and liberty built this nation, not parasites like Obama and ilk. Obama has never produce anything in his life. Nothing, zero. Yet he is qualified to lead? Really? I have worked for leaders and he is no leader.<br /><br />The economy picking up is a joke. Really? Where? 100% debt to GDP and counting and for every job created 75 food stamp recipients?  I have never seen it this slow and a second Obama term will spell the end. The tax increases alone are enough for me to call it quits. Why, I make to much so pay more of my fair share? Maybe you should attempt to understand the concept of a S Corp and how it's income becomes, for tax reasons, my income. Hence while my income may look very good on paper the vast majority of my income stays as operating revenue. So much for the fat cat theory, no?<br /><br />Why should I continue to work myself into the dirt just to have it confiscated to transfer wealth to a parasite class? The work requirement for welfare gutted, Obamaphones, the taxes in Obamacare alone are enough to throw in the towel.<br /><br />[Your column] is a fantasy of deranged and feckless liberal gibberish. What your now calling the mainstream is terminal unemployment and lower standard of living for all but then again, we all know that is the lefts dream right? After all, when your mentality is zero sum gain then making the rich poorer the poor become richer, correct? WHy let reality get in the way of your fantasy? Had the housing market, for example, been left to market forces without government intervention the housing bubble would have never happened but hey, another brilliant idea from the left. Good intentions are all that matter right?<br /><br />Try this. Open a business, deal with all the headaches for a few years, payroll, taxes, permits, employees and then come back and explain to me how Obama has helped me?<br /><br />You want jobs, you create them because I am finished. Atlas will indeed shrug and I have no clue whom you and other democrats think is going to pay the tab because there is no money left to burn.<br /><br />Then again, for the left the end justifies the means. As Milton said;, "better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven?"<br /></blockquote><br /><b>What if Romney loses? The fire next time</b>. This is from someone whose provenance I do know. Also a founder and head of a small high-technology business.<br /><blockquote>If the GOP does indeed suffer a defeat in 2012, renewing the party will be much more difficult than 1972 was for the Democrats.<br /><br />The Democratic Party of the Nixon-Reagan era could look to compromise with Republicans on a wide range of areas because those areas -- tax policy, military budgets, welfare reform -- were things on which compromise was possible. The things that could not be compromised -- civil rights, peace in Vietnam, and Social Security -- were never under serious attack. <br /><br />The Republican Party today regards sexual reregulation and religious belief as core to its identity. Abortion is murder, homosexuality is depraved, and the twin terrors of Islamic Fundamentalism and Humanism threaten to unhinge society. These are not issues on which compromise is possible.  One can regard a change to the tax code or to welfare rules as unwise, and yet acquiesce in trying the experiment. One cannot acquiesce to what one considers murder and depravity.<br /><br />The obvious parallel, alas, is to the New England resistance to slavery, 1828-1860.  Though good people tried to find a way, there really was no path to compromise. If slavery is evil, Thoreau argued, you can't sit by and regret it. If it's not evil, Calhoun was right. Between them, there was no place for Dan Webster, and the memory of Shiloh meant that, for a century, US politics carefully kept to topics on which compromise was possible.  The original nativism and know-nothing conspiracies receded. The anti-Semitism that was such a disaster for Europe never got a really respectable foothold; we had Lindberg and Father Coughlin but not Mosley and the Duke of Windsor. American Protestants stopped fighting over doctrine and stopped fighting against Catholics.<br /><br />For a long time, it seemed that no compromise was possible on the integration of the South, and the Senate was organized to make such compromise unnecessary. That ended when,  in 1948, Humphrey convinced the Democrats that segregation was no longer something that could be countenanced, that it had to end whatever the consequences for the party. And of course that did split the party and transformed the landscape of American politics into the world we know. (In the end, Johnson saw that the South could compromise on integration and still be the South: "Guess who's coming to dinner?" might be a a bit of a shock, but if it's Sidney Poitier and he's a doctor, you could live with it and talk about the Dallas Cowboys.)<br /><br />How does today's GOP sit down for a nice dinner with Planned Parenthood, Sandra Fluke, Lena Durham, and Richard Dawkins?  I used to know Republicans socially. My parents and aunts and uncles all did. I don't anymore.  Democrats and Republicans are beginning to dress differently, to wear their hair differently. Limbaugh really thinks that Sandra Fluke is a slut. You simply can't have both of them to dinner.<br /><br />In a real sense, Romney already is the Republican turn toward moderation. It's untenable; you can't defend the unborn one day, and promise to keep Roe v Wade the next. The only way Romney could moderate his positions was to be seen to lie, to convince people that he held contradictory opinions but would govern the way they hoped. There's just no viable position for a potential nominee who is more moderate the Romney. As an intellectual exercise, one could imagine a Republican who supported immigration reform, a stronger social safety net, and overturning Roe and Griswold - but this would simply alienate the tea party while remaining unacceptable to almost all Democratic voters.<br /><br />There might be scattered opportunities for the GOP, but I think this may be their high water mark, the first of a long sequence of bitter losses and painful memories, of choices between bad and worse.  But I have a very bad feeling about this: I think it ends in a the televised battle on the California border between state police seeking to apprehend an attractive young physician on charges of capital abortion, and the California National Guard who are determined to save her. The old vineyard of the grapes of wrath is closer than we imagined, and the fruit hangs heavy on the vine.<br /></blockquote>More ahead.<br /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2542731b/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=What+If+the+GOP+Loses%3F+%27Atlas+Shrugged%27+vs.+%27The+Fire+Next+Time%27&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fwhat-if-the-gop-loses-atlas-shrugged-vs-the-fire-next-time%2F264556%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=What+If+the+GOP+Loses%3F+%27Atlas+Shrugged%27+vs.+%27The+Fire+Next+Time%27&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fwhat-if-the-gop-loses-atlas-shrugged-vs-the-fire-next-time%2F264556%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658586021/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2542731b/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658586021/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2542731b/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658586021/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2542731b/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/q3LAjJzFatU" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2542731b/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cwhat0Eif0Ethe0Egop0Eloses0Eatlas0Eshrugged0Evs0Ethe0Efire0Enext0Etime0C2645560C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Why People Don't Vote—in 1 Graph</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/GgkI9KalZbY/story01.htm</link><description>There are many reasons not to vote (even though you totally should).

These updates, starting with one from Ohio:<br /><blockquote>Here's a little feel for what's going on with the Obama campaign in the north west suburbs of Cincinnati.<br /><br />After 14 months of phone calls and canvasing, I showed up to Obama headquarters in my GOP dominated town with a renewed enthusiasm and fresh legs. After knocking on 1000's of doors, mostly GOP and during weekday hours, I was pretty burned out only two weeks ago, but it was a lift to see a few familiar faces and a lot of new ones streaming in at 9am for canvass training as we kicked off GOTV. They were greeted by freshly made french sumatra coffee (fair trade and organic, of course), a selection of homemade muffins and the ubiquitous bottled water found at canvassing locations (hydrate, people!). Our canvass targets are Obama supporters who have spotty voting records, i.e. the people who are left when you subtract likely voters from registered voters (RV-LV). These are the ones that will pad Mr. Obama's margins, if the polls are correct, or will put him over the top in Ohio if they polls overstate his lead.<br /><br />I talked with a lot of RV-LV voters this weekend on the 5 canvass runs I pulled off before sidelining myself with a head gash, a trip to the emergency room and 8 staples (I got a hard head, so I'll be bringing my kids to school, making the coffee and heading to the office in a couple hours). People were happy to see me and excited to get to the polls due partly to the belief that Mr. Obama has done all that could be done to pull this country from the bring of financial ruin and put it back on course for prosperity,...Easily 90%+ people I spoke with had a plan for getting to the polls before or after work on Tuesday, were planning to bring everyone of voting age in their house with them and, if able, work election day GOTV. <br /><br />The few Romney supporters who made it on to my list were exceptionally gracious, one even taking the list of down ticket Democrats to give to her friend she had over for lunch. That right there is what makes being a foot soldier in democracy rewarding and why I tend to despise the Internet as a gauge of how polarized the electorate is. I have no doubt the pundit class and politicians are polarized, but at the end of the day, people are neighbors and we all want what is best for our children and country.<br /><br />In this town there are two rented Obama staging locations -  the Obama office and a union operated on. Each had a slew of cars coming and going from 9am till 6:30pm. Our canvassers filled the strip mall parking lot, making sure to leave open the spaces in front of the retail shops. The Romney location is right around the corner. They had a full parking lot early Saturday that emptied as the day wore on and was mostly empty Sunday.<br /></blockquote>The earlier D.C. report showed a very long (and patient) line of people waiting to vote in Ward 7 -- with the reader's speculation that lines would be shorter in the richer and whiter parts of town. In reply:<br /><blockquote>My name is [XX] and I wanted to note a "feeling" that one of your commenters is wrong. He/she said:<br /><blockquote>"I get the feeling that early voting is less of a hassle in the much more affluent Northwest quadrant as it is where I'm living and that in five or ten years, when Southeast has been colonized by wealthier (and mostly whiter) citizens, things here will begin to change." <br /></blockquote>I was an early voting poll-worker at Judiciary Square, which covered Ward 2 voters (the commenter's affluent NW residents-Dupont, Foggy Bottom, Georgetown, etc), as well as voters across DC. The line wrapped around the building and the wait, some voters said, was as long as three hours. High turnout was one factor but also equipment breakdowns in other voting sites led to a flood of voters coming to Judiciary Square. So, really, not that much of a difference. On one side, Judiciary Square is a bigger site with more equipment and workers because it is supposed to be able to accommodate voters from all precincts. The downside of that is that Judiciary Square can get quite busy, if not busier than the satellite locations.<br /> <br />Election day might be different, but I think the DC Board of Elections does a pretty good job at trying to adjust workers and equipment based on population density. Anyways, the income and race divide does structure much of life here in the District, but I think voting is one place where I don't believe there to be much of a difference.<br /></blockquote>Similarly, from another reader:<br /><blockquote>I can offer first-hand experience refuting your reader's presumption that early voting is any easier in Northwest DC. I live in Ward 1, Columbia Heights - not the leafy surburb your other reader imagined by any means, but certainly a rapidly-gentrifying area. The first time I went to vote was a Saturday afternoon two weeks ago, and I was told the wait would be 2.5-3 hours. The line snaked around the gym several times, so I took the volunteer who offered that information at her word. When I tried again (no, I didn't wait the first time) in the early evening of Halloween, it took all of 20 minutes. Another, perhaps more complete,  counterexample comes from my girlfriend, whose early voting location is in Chevy Chase. Now that really is the embodiment of affluent Northwest DC, and she waited around three hours to vote. <br /><br />By no means do I want to undercut the notion that voting is generally a more difficult proposition in more impoverished areas -- all the evidence points to that being true. At least in DC though, I can anecdotally attest that that isn't necessarily the case. It's not like there are any scheming GOP election officials here looking to suppress Democratic turnout! I think we also have to consider that there simply aren't enough resources devoted to the electoral process, period, such that a high-turnout scenario will create difficulties no matter how well-organized the local board of elections is.</blockquote><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2541da8c/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Ground-Game+Reports%3A+Ohio%2C+D.C.&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fground-game-reports-ohio-dc%2F264537%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Ground-Game+Reports%3A+Ohio%2C+D.C.&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fground-game-reports-ohio-dc%2F264537%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658584296/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2541da8c/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658584296/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2541da8c/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658584296/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2541da8c/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/CI-hhGrgj_0" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2541da8c/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cground0Egame0Ereports0Eohio0Edc0C2645370C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>JFK's Pro-Voting PSA, Shot Days After the Cuban Missile Crisis Ended</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/lQDGAyGxspA/story01.htm</link><description>The president's case for citizens to go to the polls remains potent 50 years later.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25413b6a/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=JFK%27s+Pro-Voting+PSA%2C+Shot+Days+After+the+Cuban+Missile+Crisis+Ended&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjfks-pro-voting-psa-shot-days-after-the-cuban-missile-crisis-ended%2F264480%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=JFK%27s+Pro-Voting+PSA%2C+Shot+Days+After+the+Cuban+Missile+Crisis+Ended&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjfks-pro-voting-psa-shot-days-after-the-cuban-missile-crisis-ended%2F264480%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:35:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-05:mt-264480</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Screenshot</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/JFKPSA.thumb.screenshot.jpg" /><dc:creator>David A.

Kennedy on October 31, 1962. It was a tense time: The <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/the-cuban-missile-crisis-50-years-later/263617/">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> had officially ended just three days earlier, and the nation was still on edge about the prospect of nuclear apocalypse. In that atmosphere, Kennedy filmed this ad. </p><p> As the nation marks the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and with Election Day falling on the same date (November 6) this year, it's worth heeding Kennedy's words again. In less than a minute, he pulls off an impressive rhetorical feat, <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm">echoing his famous inaugural address</a> calling on citizens do what they can for the country, and using repetition to make an emotional appeal that skirts jingoism and is marred only by its male-centered approach. Here's a transcript: </p><blockquote>In these tense and anxious weeks, I know that every American citizen wants to know what we can do for his country. Not everyone can serve in our armed forces or serve our government, but there is one thing you can do. There is one way you can indicate your devotion to freedom. There is one way in which we can show how strongly we believe in our democracy. Next Tuesday, November 6, is Election Day. I hope every American will turn out and vote -- every American, every member of his family -- and show the world how strongly we believe in freedom, how strongly we believe in our country, how strongly we believe in democracy.</blockquote> Kennedy could make the plea with some confidence -- his Democratic Party lost ground in the House in the midterm elections, but maintained majorities in both chambers. But that doesn't detract from the eloquence of his explanation for the importance of voting. <p></p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25413b6a/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=JFK%27s+Pro-Voting+PSA%2C+Shot+Days+After+the+Cuban+Missile+Crisis+Ended&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjfks-pro-voting-psa-shot-days-after-the-cuban-missile-crisis-ended%2F264480%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=JFK%27s+Pro-Voting+PSA%2C+Shot+Days+After+the+Cuban+Missile+Crisis+Ended&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjfks-pro-voting-psa-shot-days-after-the-cuban-missile-crisis-ended%2F264480%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658581196/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25413b6a/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/lQDGAyGxspA" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25413b6a/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cjfks0Epro0Evoting0Epsa0Eshot0Edays0Eafter0Ethe0Ecuban0Emissile0Ecrisis0Eended0C264480A0C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Florida Early Voting 'Working as Intended'</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/h_4DbpnswQc/story01.htm</link><description>There's no real reason to enact tactics like shortened early voting except to make voting as onerous as possible.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25409ad0/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Florida+Early+Voting+%27Working+as+Intended%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fflorida-early-voting-working-as-intended%2F264520%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Florida+Early+Voting+%27Working+as+Intended%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fflorida-early-voting-working-as-intended%2F264520%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658607628/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25409ad0/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658607628/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25409ad0/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658607628/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25409ad0/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:18:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-05:mt-264520</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Associated Press</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/tanehisicoates/floridalines.thumb.AP.jpg" /><dc:creator>Ta-Nehisi Coates</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[Florida's Democratic Party is suing the state of Florida, attempting to extend voting hours, given that wait times for early voting have stretched <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/democrats-sue-to-extend-floridas-early-voting/?partner=rss&emc=rss">up to seven hours</a>:<blockquote><div><div><div>Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, local election supervisors in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties, where lines sometimes snaked out the door and around buildings, said they would allow voters to request and cast absentee ballots on Sunday.

Here is <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/ask-dr-popkin-can-the-romney-campaign-be-saved/262813/">one from late September</a>, with links to some other installments.<br /><br />Now for his last dispatch before the election, Popkin gives us a "pre-mortem." He works from the assumption that all current indications hold, Barack Obama wins, Mitt Romney loses, and the margin is clear enough to spare us prolonged recounts, legal battles, and other complications. Here goes. Again, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/who-says-were-a-divided-nation/264524/">for the record</a>, this is part of the day-long Festival of Hourly Posts to distract us all from the last spasm of the campaign. I've added emphasis in his message.<br /><blockquote><b>Q</b>. Greetings, Sam. I know that you've been revving up to do a pre-mortem on the 2012 campaign, before it's actually finished. Today's the last chance. So what do you say?<br /><br /><b>Samuel Popkin</b>:<br />I'm writing a premortem of the election because if Mitt Romney wins on Tuesday, it will be weeks before I understand where I went wrong.  Nate Silver, Simon Jackman and Simon Wang do independent, sophisticated statistical integration of state and local polls, and all predict an Obama victory to be highly probable.  <br /><br /><b>Beyond poll-crunching, however, there are other key signs Obama is on his way to serving a second term</b>.  Republican Governors Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell, by praising President Obama, and New York's formerly Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg, by endorsing him, are not <i>leading</i> their supporters to Obama; they are <i>following</i> them to protect their own political futures because they believe Obama will win.  Bloomberg wants to preserve his centrist credentials, and there is no easier way to separate from Romney then by emphasizing the urgency of dealing with climate change.  Christie governs a state in which the president is popular; his sudden admiration of Obama benefits both of them at the expense of Romney, who will have no way of paying Christie back if he loses.  McDonnell was an early supporter of the Ryan budget, but now is backing away from the devilish details in that budget - like slashing FEMA.<br /><br />After every presidential election campaign I rethink the implications of two kinds of surprises: <b>events that surprised me by mattering more than I expected</b>, and, like Sherlock Holmes and the hound that never barked, the <b>events that didn't happen</b>.  An incumbent is evaluated more on his record than on his campaign, so my focus here is on the challenger's campaign.<br /> <br />First note that the rationalizations and finger-pointing are already leaking out from the Romney campaign and the Republican Party.   I believe the leakers are engaged in "myth-making" to <b>overstate the importance of one or more of three factors:  Tropical Storm Sandy, the first debate, or the personal failings of Governor Romney</b>. <br /> <br /><b>Myth One is that Sandy defeated Mitt Romney</b>. On October 31, two days after Sandy battered the eastern seaboard, Karl Rove wrote that the national numbers favored Romney.  By this weekend he was giving interviews about the October surprise that took the wind out of the Romney campaign.<br /> <br />If Romney stalled because Sandy deprived him of news coverage, that means that paid media - which never stopped - was ineffective. Overstating the electoral effect of Sandy is a way of explaining away the fact that all that paid media bought by the Republican Super-PACs was of limited value at the end of a presidential race.<br /> <br /><b>Myth Two is that the first debate was a Game Changer for Romney</b>.  Yes, Romney was at his best and Obama was flat - even by the standards of past incumbents, who typically are at their worst in the first debate after four years inside the presidential bubble.  But the "permanent" bump in the polls was smaller than claimed by reporters craving a new story line.<br />  <br />At no point <i>before or after</i> the first debate did Mitt Romney ever lead in enough state polls to cobble together 270 electoral votes.  When Karl Rove talked about national polls in his Wall Street Journal column last week, he knew full well that state polls are a more accurate prediction of election outcomes.  That is why he seldom relied on national polls in the presidential campaigns he ran in the past.<br /><br /><b>Romney definitely gained two to three points after the Denver debate</b>, as reluctant Republicans and Independents returned home.  That may have prevented an Obama blowout, but it was too little too late. <br />   <br /><b>Myth Three is that the Republicans lost because Romney was a lousy candidate</b>.  A Republican capable of winning the Massachusetts gubernatorial election - not to mention one capable of enacting the cost-saving healthcare policy advocated by the Heritage Foundation - is not devoid of talent.  And were his oft-discussed personality flaws any worse than Richard Nixon's? <br /> <br />To put it bluntly: either the Romney campaign never had a chance, or they blew it through early strategic choices.  I believe that, while it is never easy to take on an incumbent, <b>the Romney campaign lost whatever chance they had because of early mistakes.</b><br />  <br /><b>Whenever you hear politicians say an election is not about the party, you can be sure it is about the party</b>.  The Romney campaign had some serious shortcomings but their major errors were made in the primary, when they miscalculated how much red meat they could feed their voracious base and still win in November.  Either they overestimated how damaged Obama would be by the bad economy or they overestimated how much damage Romney could sustain in the primaries and still recover.   Either way, the underlying fault lies with the Republican Party's increasingly radical policies, which placed Romney in the perilous position of reconciling the concerns of the independents needed to win the general election with the demands of primary voters who had been promised the moon.<br /> <br />Twelve months ago Stuart Stevens, Romney's strategist, told Robert Draper, "The economy is overwhelmingly the issue. Our whole campaign is premised on the idea that this is a referendum on Obama, the economy is a disaster and Obama is uniquely blocked from being able to talk about jobs." Stevens came up with a clever refrain - "Obama Isn't Working" - but never produced a strategy to make this a one-issue election, instead opening the door for Obama to talk about what he had done to save jobs, contrast himself with Romney, who had sent them overseas when he ran Bain.<br />  <br />In 1968, Richard Nixon evaded the press, never divulging his secret plan for Vietnam or explaining how he would restore law and order by quelling anti-war and civil rights protests.  But he didn't have to. Those two dominant issues were answered by Nixon's strong track record on foreign policy and the overwhelming perception of the Republican Party as the party of law and order.  <br /><br />In contrast, the Republican party of 2012 does not have a solid track record on the issues of the day, including immigration, Medicare, and aid to education as well as job growth.  When Romney picked Paul Ryan over Chris Christie for vice-president, I assumed they would soon announce a revised Romney-Ryan budget to move toward the center and jettison the most politically damaging parts of a very unpopular budget.  Instead they avoided discussing the budget at all, save for protests that it was too "wonky" or complicated for voters to understand.<br /> <br /><b>The business school star who excelled at strategic planning at Bain has failed to plan ahead on his own campaign</b>. James Carville's famous credo, "the economy, stupid," helped keep the 1992 focus on the economy, which was possible only because Bill Clinton had developed reasonable policies on crime, welfare and abortion that protected him against an ambush on social issues on his way to battle on the economy.  If an army knows the grounds on which they want to fight, they need to suppress enemy fire on the march to their preferred battlefield.<br />  <br />This is why I believe some of the strategists are overstating the bump after the first debate.  The Romney campaign was criticized publicly and often for allowing the Obama campaign to define him.  If, however, Romney's performance in Denver led to a winning swing in his direction, it validates the idea that Obama's attacks on Romney's record and character were better answered in the debate, when people had started to pay closer attention.  I don't buy that argument; if Romney was right to wait, then John Kerry's campaign was right to ignore the swiftboating attacks during the summer of 2004, too.<br /><br /><b>From the day he clinched the nomination, I kept wondering why Romney didn't distinguish his political identity from his party's</b>, just as Bill Clinton showed he was willing to challenge special interests within his party by publicly criticizing Sister Souljah's lyrics in front of Jesse Jackson.<br />  <br />Stuart Stevens is a veteran of the 2000 and 2004 Bush campaigns, but he did not appear to appreciate the difference between the political terrain in 2004 and 2012.  In 2004, when Democrats painted Cheney as a profiteering military contractor, Stevens invited them to "Bring it on!" The attacks on the VP only served to fire up the conservative base and keep the focus on the Republican-friendly issue of national security.  <br /><br />Well, letting Obama "bring it on" in 2012 - when the president's campaign hammered Romney as a rich, heartless financier - didn't fire up the Republican base and keep the focus on jobs.  Thanks to Super-PACs aligned with Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, millions of dollars had already been spent during the primaries attacking Romney for the way Bain left employees without jobs or pensions.  As I learned in 1992 when I worked with the Clinton campaign, early mud washes off slowly.<br /><br /><b>A politician's personal character is a moral firewall</b>; it reassures people about a candidate's past record or the unsavory planks of his party's platform.   People do assume that wealthy people like Romney are smarter and work harder than most others.  They also, as Pew research has revealed, consider the very rich more greedy than others.  I confess to being totally unable to explain why Romney waited so long to talk about his church and community service, or why someone who wanted to be president wouldn't have closed his Cayman Islands and Swiss bank accounts before he became a candidate.  <br /><br /><b>People "Envy up and Scorn Down,"</b> as the Princeton psychologist Susan Fiske explains.   People who envy Romney's wealth and lifestyle may also wonder if he scorns them.  Note how often Democrats characterized Romney as thinking that voters are "too dumb to notice" when talking about  the details of Ryan budget.  <br /><br /><b>The civil war in the Republican Party has already begun</b>. I expect the big push for Republican rebranding to occur at the state and local levels, where governance is critical to anyone with long-term national ambitions. Look for Republican governors to fight for programs they need to govern.  (Senators build identities and raise money on issue positions, not performance, and are far slower to change.) I believe that Governors Christie and McDonnell went farther than necessary in their praise of President Obama because they wanted to distance themselves as fast as possible from a budget Republican budget that would slash funding for FEMA and turn disaster relief over to the states.  <br /><br />After Vice President Walter Mondale lost the 1984 election, the Democratic Party, led by governors in the Democratic Leadership Council, moved toward the center because enough Democratic politicians recognized that the fundamental problem was the party, not the candidate or his campaign.   Let's see if enough Republicans can see through the rationalizing myths to save their party in the same way.<br /></blockquote><br /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25403c51/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Ask+Dr.+Popkin%3A+The+3+Myths+of+the+Romney+Campaign&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fask-dr-popkin-the-3-myths-of-the-romney-campaign%2F264532%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Ask+Dr.+Popkin%3A+The+3+Myths+of+the+Romney+Campaign&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fask-dr-popkin-the-3-myths-of-the-romney-campaign%2F264532%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658579465/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25403c51/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658579465/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25403c51/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658579465/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25403c51/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/sNmf43jORU4" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25403c51/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cask0Edr0Epopkin0Ethe0E30Emyths0Eof0Ethe0Eromney0Ecampaign0C2645320C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>If Not for the Hurricane</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/CzzTq6xJNtQ/story01.htm</link><description>When you believe in magic, you can never be wrong.

Richard Trumka asks. </p><p> Trumka, the bulb-nosed, bristle-mustached president of the AFL-CIO, is sitting in a conference room at the union's headquarters in Columbus, where he has come to fire up the troops in advance of the presidential election. </p><p> Here's the joke: A man sees a sign by the side of the road reading, "Republican puppies, $50." He stops for a look, but he's headed out of town and can't take one. Six weeks or so later, he passes by again. This time, the sign reads "Democrat puppies, $100." </p><p> "He stops and looks and he says, 'Wait a second, these are the same puppies,'" Trumka says, jabbing a stubby forefinger for emphasis. "And the guy says, 'Yeah, but now they have their eyes open.'" </p><p> To Trumka, the joke has a kernel of truth: People will vote the right way, he tells me -- but only after you open their eyes to the things they need to know. </p><p> President Obama, you may have heard, appears to be in good shape to win <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/why-obama-is-relying-on-the-rustbelt-instead-of-the-sunbelt/263926/">Ohio and other Rust Belt states</a> on Tuesday, in large part due to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/meet-the-ohio-voters-who-are-killing-romneys-campaign/263061/">white working-class voters' distrust</a> of his opponent, Mitt Romney. But that impression didn't take hold on its own, nor was it the sole creation of the Obama campaign. It had a lot of help from Trumka and his minions. </p><p> "A year ago, all the talk was Obama could never win with high unemployment," the AFL-CIO's political director, Mike Podhorzer, wrote in a recent memo. "The early conventional wisdom went further, writing off working class voters, asserting that the only path available to President Obama was upscale voters in states like North Carolina." Instead, the demographic that should have been Obama's greatest weakness may be the one that saves the election for him. </p><p> Indeed, if the manufacturing states of the Upper Midwest end up forming a surprising electoral-vote firewall for Obama, insulating his reelection bid from potential losses in Florida, Virginia, and Colorado, he will owe a debt of gratitude to the unions, who have been working doggedly, and largely under the radar, on his behalf. In the last four days of the presidential campaign, the AFL-CIO says its 128,000 volunteers will have knocked on 5.5 million doors, made 5.2 million phone calls and passed out 2 million leaflets in six targeted states. In Ohio alone, the union has 20 staging areas from which to make those calls and send crews out to knock on doors. </p><p> On Saturday morning, Tim Burga, the wiry president of the Ohio AFL-CIO, stood under an alphabet soup of signs, unions being second only to the military in their zeal for acronyms: AFSCME for Obama-Biden, NATCA, TWU, AFT, UFCW. Like a boxer entering the ring, he had taken off his mustard-colored work jacket, revealing a black IUPAT tee beneath. </p><p> "We've been active for a good long time now," Burga said. "We need to leave it all on the field now for the next four days. Walk till our feet are hurting. Talk till our throats are scratchy. Go to the work sites, pull every last vote out that we can pull out." The 40 or so union members in the low-ceilinged back room, a group long on pot bellies and mustaches, nodded approvingly. There was also a woman in a T-shirt reading "Kicking Ass for the Working Class." </p><p> "And when we do that," Burga continued, "we're going to say to America: 'Ohio won this election! Labor won this election, and we did it for the working people!' Are you with me?" "Yeah!" the group shouted. </p><p> The unions' effort is much bigger than four years ago, Trumka says, because of the campaign-finance changes stemming from the <em>Citizens United</em> decision of the Supreme Court, which made it legal for unions to engage in political communication with the general public, not just their own members. "Trust me, it's a horrible, horrible thing, and it's corrosive to democracy," Trumka says of <em>Citizens United</em>. "The only good thing it did is, it gave us the ability to do a super PAC so that we could talk to nonunion workers." </p><p> The organizing effort in Ohio got a jumpstart a year ago, when the state's Republican governor, John Kasich, attempted to pass changes to collective-bargaining rights. Labor revolted against the legislation, known as Senate Bill 5, and staged a referendum to repeal it that ended up passing with 62 percent of the vote. The success of that effort laid the groundwork for this year's political mobilization on behalf of Obama, Senator Sherrod Brown (who is also favored to win, despite having tens of millions spent against him by the Chamber of Commerce and other interest groups), and other Democrats. </p> <!-- PULL QUOTE v. 1 --> <blockquote style="background:#fff; border-bottom: 3px solid #D6E3E9; border-top: 3px solid #D6E3E9; color: #003D64; float: left; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic; line-height: 28px; width: 230px; margin: 5px 25px 5px 0; padding: 15px 10px !important;"> "Trust me, Citizens United is a horrible, horrible thing, and it's corrosive to democracy," Trumka says. "The only good thing it did is, it gave us the ability to do a super PAC." </blockquote> <!-- END PULL QUOTE v. 1 --> <p> I spent a couple of hours Saturday afternoon walking a mixed-race, working-class neighborhood on the east side of Columbus with Diana Vernon, a sunny 51-year-old head cook for a suburban school district. Canvassing is thankless work -- hours on your feet, trudging from door to door to remind people to vote, almost none of whom are home -- yet Vernon does it almost every weekend, and last week spent a full day in the rain distributing literature for a union-backed ballot measure. </p><p> "Some of my coworkers are voting for Romney," Vernon admitted. "I'm like, 'How can you? You're a regular working person. You're a lunch lady!' But a lot of it is social issues." </p><p> When the canvassing gets discouraging, Vernon thinks back to the SB5 fight. "A lot of people got out and worked really hard, and I really do think we made a difference," she said. "I just think you've got to stand up for what you believe in." </p><p> In polls, and in my own conversations with Ohioans, there's a clear sense that Romney is viewed as out of touch with the working class of this acutely class-conscious, industrial state, of which old-line unions still form the backbone. Back at the union hall, I ask Trumka how much of that perception the union can take credit for. </p><p> Trumka laughs heartily, his brown eyes squinting. "Look, Romney did that," he says. "Romney doesn't have a clue what working people are going through. Now, did we point that out to a lot of people? Absolutely, because it's something they need to know." According to the union's research, among the people it reached, its messaging caused Romney's support to drop 30 points among white males and 50 points among born-again Christians. That's the moral of the puppy joke. </p><p> Though they are working in lockstep today, unions and Obama have not always been the happiest of political bedfellows. The Employee Free Choice Act, the legislation commonly known as card check that labor had hoped would be the reward for its $400 million investment in the 2008 election, fizzled early in Obama's term. From antagonizing the teachers unions to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/unions-prepare-for-a-bittersweet-labor-day-in-charlotte-and-nationwide/261877/">staging this year's Democratic convention in a right-to-work state</a>, the president has frequently frustrated his erstwhile union allies. </p><p> "Democrats are not the labor party; they're the party we have to rely on," Bruce Bostick, the mustached manager of the Ohio steelworkers' retiree fund, tells me. He's wearing faded jeans, a beret, and a vintage Sherrod Brown for Congress button from 1996, speckled with rust. "Frankly, I think labor as a movement has dropped the ball," Bostick adds. "We didn't build a movement on the outside to hold the Democrats' feet to the fire. So we got a convoluted health-care bill, no national jobs program, and a stimulus nobody understood." </p><p> Despite such rumblings of dissatisfaction, there's one major force keeping labor on Obama's side: the Republican Party, which, Trumka says, has adopted "the most anti-worker, anti-union platform of any major party in the history of the United States. It's mobilized us, it's energized us, it's brought us together with more solidarity than we've had in years." </p><p> The conundrum, for the unions, is ensuring they don't get taken for granted when and if Obama does win a second term. Now that victory is in sight, Trumka wants to make it clear that labor plans to collect what they feel they are owed. </p><p> "Look, we've laid some markers down," he says. "No tax cuts for the rich, not an extension of those tax cuts, not one minute. Two, no cuts in benefits for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And we'll fight for those things. We'll fight no matter who proposes them. If a Democrat proposes them, we'll go after them as well." </p><p> But can labor credibly threaten the Democrats, given that they have nowhere else to go? "Of course we have an option," Trumka says. "It's real simple. There's things called primaries." He pauses to let this threat sink in. </p><p> "If they're voting against what the people want, it'll cost them. It'll cost them big time," he adds. "No one will be immune. We're going to hold people accountable." </p><p> I note that Trumka hasn't mentioned card check, or as he prefers to call it, "labor law reform."

The idea behind this measure, Proposition 34, is that death penalty is too expensive and therefore should be abolished. The idea is so morally vapid that it's hard to believe people would take it seriously. <b>Justice should never be a matter of money.</b>  Do supporters of Prop. 34 really mean to suggest that, yes, heinous murderers should be executed, but because it's costly we should allow every murderer to live? <br /></p></blockquote>What I wonder is if Prager fully understands the implications of his argument, which I'd urge him to carry to its logical conclusion. If justice should <i>never</i> be a matter of money, will he start using his radio show and columns to insist that the people who perform autopsies be <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/forensics/">adequately trained and funded</a>? Will he urge legislators to approve funds to remedy <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-to-introduce-forensics-reform-legislation-in-new-congress">the atrocious state of forensic investigation in America</a>, and fund "<a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/03/14/getting-forensics-right">rivalrous redundancy</a>," so that private labs would check up on the work of state-run forensic teams that often make mistakes? Will he insist on compensating the victims of guys like <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2009/02/19/reasons-reporting-on-steven-ha">Steven Hayne</a> -- or at least speak out against state laws that leave some wrongly jailed victims of prosecutorial misconduct <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2010/11/12/wrongly-convicted-missouri-man">without any state compensation</a> at all upon their release? Will he speak up against <a href="http://www.ij.org/policing-for-profit-the-abuse-of-civil-asset-forfeiture-4">asset-forfeiture laws</a> that give law-enforcement agencies across the country a financial incentive to victimize innocent people?<br /><br />After all, justice should never be a matter of money, right? And yet all over America, there are countless areas where additional funding could prevent innocents from being subject to unjust state action. But they are never funded, and more often than not conservatives are the ones standing in the way.   <br /><br />In 2010, the Innocence Project <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/250.php">documented</a> 250 cases in which DNA testing overturned wrongful convictions. As Radley Balko <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/02/08/how-many-more-are-innocent">wrote</a> in an item discussing the report and its implications (emphasis added):<br /><blockquote><p>Calculating the percentage of innocents now in prison is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/us/25bar.html">a tricky and controversial process</a>. The numerator itself is difficult enough to figure out. The certainty of DNA testing means we can be positive the 250 cases listed in the Innocence Project report didn't commit the crimes for which they were convicted, and that number also continues to rise. But there are hundreds of other cases in which convictions have been overturned due to a lack of evidence, recantation of eyewitness testimony, or police or prosecutorial misconduct, but for which there was no DNA evidence to establish definitive guilt or innocence. Those were wrongful convictions in that there wasn't sufficient evidence to establish reasonable doubt, but we can't be sure all the accused were factually innocent.</p><p>Most prosecutors fight requests for post-conviction DNA testing. That means the discovery of wrongful convictions is limited by the time and resources available to the Innocence Project and similar legal aid organizations to fight for a test in court. It's notable that <b>in one of the few jurisdictions where the district attorney is actively seeking out wrongful convictions -- <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/dna">Dallas County, Texas</a> -- the county by itself has seen more exonerations than all but a handful of individual states. If prosecutors in other jurisdictions were to follow <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2008/04/07/is-this-americas-best-prosecut"> Dallas D.A. Craig Watkins'</a> lead, that 250 figure would be significantly higher.</b></p></blockquote> So why not fund a program that pays for post-conviction DNA testing in all states, and in all cases where physical evidence that could exonerate an innocent convict is available? The evidence that doing so would free at least one innocent person is so overwhelming that to argue otherwise would be absurd. The real number of innocents exonerated would be much higher. But even if only one innocent were freed, Mr. Prager, should the funds be allocated, or would justice prove too expensive? If only death-penalty supporters were as outraged by flaws in the criminal-justice system as in the prospect of executions halting, the case for halting executions would be much weaker than it is. <br /><br />At present, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann">the case is strong</a>.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253ebf32/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=A+Challenge+to+Dennis+Prager%2C+Death-Penalty+Supporter&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fa-challenge-to-dennis-prager-death-penalty-supporter%2F264518%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=A+Challenge+to+Dennis+Prager%2C+Death-Penalty+Supporter&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fa-challenge-to-dennis-prager-death-penalty-supporter%2F264518%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572876/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf32/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572876/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf32/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658572876/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf32/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/e1I4CwkMIAU" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253ebf32/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Ca0Echallenge0Eto0Edennis0Eprager0Edeath0Epenalty0Esupporter0C2645180C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Just a Reminder: The Most Important State on Election Day Is California</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/W02LN8c71mE/story01.htm</link><description>The outcome is nearly certain.

So long, in fact, that the average American could be forgiven for forgetting that Ohio and Florida aren't the places with the most power to choose the next president of the United States.<br /><br />As Barack Obama and Mitt Romney vie to win 270 electoral votes, the state that matters most is California. The Golden State and its 37.7 million residents confer 55 electoral votes -- three times more than little Ohio, which would suffer through fewer <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/life-in-ohio-center-of-the-political-universe/264500/">months of awful campaign ads</a> if only its voters would stop changing their minds about whether they want to cast red or blue ballots.<br /><br />Texas is the second-most important state in this year's election. It'll add 38 electoral votes to Mitt Romney's tally. If he improbably lost the state, where he's <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/tx/texas_romney_vs_obama-1945.html">leading by roughly 17 points</a>, there's no way he'd win the election. It's even more important to him than Florida, with its 29 electoral votes. Florida is tied for third-most important with New York, which also confers 29 electoral votes. Don't let the fact that Romney spends more time trying to win Florida fool you into imagining that it matters more than Texas. It's just that Romney can win the Lone Star State without trying. <br /> <br />Here are the states ranked from most important to least important in presidential elections, along with their electoral votes:<br /><br />California - 55    <br />Texas - 38<br />New York - 29<br />Florida - 29<br />Illinois - 20<br />Pennsylvania - 20<br />Ohio - 18<br />Michigan - 16<br />Georgia - 16<br />New Jersey - 14<br />North Carolina - 15<br />Virginia - 13<br />Washington - 12<br />Massachusetts - 11<br />Indiana - 11<br />Tennessee - 11<br />Arizona - 11<br />Missouri - 10<br />Maryland - 10<br />Wisconsin - 10<br />Minnesota - 10<br />Colorado - 9<br />Alabama - 9<br />South Carolina - 9<br />Louisiana - 8<br />Kentucky - 8<br />Oregon - 7<br />Oklahoma - 7<br />Connecticut - 7<br />Iowa - 6<br />Mississippi - 6<br />Arkansas - 6<br />Kansas - 6<br />Utah - 6<br />Nevada - 6<br />New Mexico - 5<br />West Virginia - 5<br />Nebraska - 5<br />Idaho - 4<br />Maine - 4<br />New Hampshire - 4<br />Hawaii - 4<br />Rhode Island - 4<br />Montana - 3<br />Delaware - 3<br />South Dakota - 3<br />Alaska - 3<br />North Dakota - 3<br />Vermont - 3<br />Washington, D.C. - 3<br />Wyoming - 3<br /><br />I've listed these so that you can marvel at California's clout. It matters five times as much as Arizona. It matters more than Florida and Ohio combined. A candidate who wins California can lose West Virginia, Nebraska, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont, D.C., and Wyoming ... and <i>still</i> be ahead. And deservedly so. If you listed the 10 most populous cities in the United States, California would appear three times -- Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose -- and neither Ohio nor Florida would make the list. If you were to list the top 15 cities, California would have four of them, Texas would have four too, and Florida and Ohio would have one each (Jacksonville and Columbus). California cities bigger than Cleveland include Oakland, Long Beach, Sacramento, Fresno, and San Francisco, along with the four bigger cities mentioned above.<br /><br />The GOP candidate won California in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, and 1988, but hasn't won it since. Bill Clinton won California in 1992 with 46 percent of the vote. (Ross Perot won 20 percent of the California vote that year!) In 1996, Clinton won 54 percent of its voters. Al Gore won 53 percent of the California vote in 2000, John Kerry won 54 percent, and Barack Obama won 61 percent in 2008. When Obama wins California this year, he'll be a fifth of the way to 270.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253ebf2f/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Just+a+Reminder%3A+The+Most+Important+State+on+Election+Day+Is+California&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjust-a-reminder-the-most-important-state-on-election-day-is-california%2F264501%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Just+a+Reminder%3A+The+Most+Important+State+on+Election+Day+Is+California&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fjust-a-reminder-the-most-important-state-on-election-day-is-california%2F264501%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572874/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf2f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572874/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf2f/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658572874/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253ebf2f/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/W02LN8c71mE" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253ebf2f/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cjust0Ea0Ereminder0Ethe0Emost0Eimportant0Estate0Eon0Eelection0Eday0Eis0Ecalifornia0C26450A10C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>No One in America Should Have to Wait 7 Hours to Vote</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/g4dnuqb5HMc/story01.htm</link><description>What's happening at polling stations in Ohio and Florida isn't some fluke of nature or breakdown in equipment.

(<a href="https://twitter.com/finneganlatimes/status/265171353055948801/photo/1/large">Michael Finnegan/Twitter</a>)</div> </div><div><br /></div>No matter who wins the presidential race, no matter which party controls Congress, can we at least agree as reasonable adults that when it comes to voting itself the election of 2012 is a national disgrace? We ask our sons and daughters, our husbands and wives, to give their lives abroad for noble concepts like "freedom" and "democracy." And yet we are content as a nation, and as a people, to tolerate another cycle of election rules that require our fellow citizens to sacrifice a measure of basic human dignity simply to exercise their right to vote.<br /><br />For example, what happened this weekend in Florida is simply unacceptable. According to a local election official interviewed by CBS News' Phil Hirschkorn, the last "early voter" in line for Saturday's truncated early voting in Palm Beach County finally got to cast a ballot at 2:30 a.m Sunday morning, which means that voter waited in line for more than seven hours. In Miami, another traditional Democratic stronghold, the wait was <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/11/03/last-day-of-early-voting-opens-in-miami-dade/">said</a> to be nearly as long. On Sunday, voters all over the state were begging judges and county officials for more time to vote.<br /><br />This is happening not because of a natural disaster or breakdown in machinery. It is happening by partisan design. Alarmed by the strong Democratic turnout in early voting in 2008, Republican lawmakers, including Governor Rick Scott, reduced the number of early voting days from 14 to eight. When the restrictions were challenged in federal court under the Voting Rights Act, a three-judge panel said they would have a <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/federal_court_rules_floridas_shortening_of_early_v.php">discriminatory impact upon minority voters</a>. But only five of the state's 67 counties are covered by the federal civil rights law. <br /><br />When the remaining restrictions were challenged in federal court, a George W. Bush appointee said there was no proof that the reduced hours would "<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/09/25/903491/federal-judge-allows-florida-to-cut-early-voting-days/">impermissibly burden</a>" minority voters. How many hours in line must a Florida voter wait before the burden upon her becomes an "impermissible" one? If Florida's election officials, and its Republican lawmakers, and its state and federal judges, all were required to stand in line for seven hours to vote those long lines would go away forever. You know it, I know it, and so do those officials.<br /><br />How about Ohio, another "battleground" state governed by partisan fiat. Its election rules are administered by a secretary of state, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/say-hello-to-the-ohio-official-who-might-pick-the-next-president/264201/">Jon Husted</a>, who just a few years ago was the GOP speaker of the state house. Like their counterparts in Florida, Ohio's Republican lawmakers sought to restrict wildly popular early-voting hours around the state. And again the federal courts <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/ohio_early_voting_obama_romney.php">blunted</a> the impact of their new rules. So what has Husted done? He's focused his energy this weekend <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/ohios-provisional-ballot-order-the-biggest-legal-story-of-the-weekend/264498/">ginning up ways</a> to justify discarding provisional ballots cast by his fellow citizens.<br /><br />These are just two recent examples. There are more. But they all have a few core things in common. In each instance, elected officials are making it harder for American citizens to vote and to have their votes counted. And in each instance, the partisan restrictions are designed to impact the elderly, and the poor, and students. The Constitution gives power to the states to handle elections. But what we are seeing is one party's systemic abuse of that power to disenfranchise likely voters of another party. Don't believe me? Let's go to the videotape.<br /> <!-- PULL QUOTE v. 1 --> <blockquote style="background:#fff; border-bottom: 3px solid #D6E3E9; border-top: 3px solid #D6E3E9; color: #003D64; float: left; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic; line-height: 28px; width: 230px; margin: 5px 25px 5px 0; padding: 15px 10px !important;"> There is no hidden agenda here.

First pro-life legislation -- abortion facility regulations -- in 22 years, done. Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done." In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/us/politics/ohio-early-voting-battle-flares-after-racial-comment-by-republican-official.html?_r=0">Ohio</a>, the Republican Party chairman of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, was even more blunt. Doug Preisse said, "I guess I really actually feel we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate the urban -- read African-American -- voter turnout machine."<br /><br />There is no hidden agenda here. The strategy and tactics are as far out in the open as those voters standing in line for hours waiting for their turn to vote. This transparency -- of motive and of evidence -- is also what distinguishes the complaints that Democrats have about Republican tricks on voting from Republican complaints about Democratic tricks on voting. Widespread "in-person" voter fraud or voting by illegal immigrants exists <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/29/121029fa_fact_mayer">mostly in the minds of conspiracy theorists</a>. Yet proof of voter suppression is visible to all of us with the naked eye. All we have to do is look. There is no political equivalence here -- <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/false-equivalence-in-the-new-york-times-voting-rights-story/262436/">only more lamentable false equivalence</a>.  <br /><br />Indeed, we are all complicit in a regime which forces our fellow citizens to endure those long lines. We are all to blame for allowing men like Jon Husted to determine which Ohioans will have their ballots counted and which will not. We who have the luxury of voting early by mail or who can pop into a polling station on Election Day, who are accustomed to not standing long for anything -- we do nothing about these voter lines even though they are the most visible proof today that America is still terribly divided by race and by class.<br /><br />In America in 2012, poor people and elderly people and students should not have to wait seven hours to vote. They should not be restricted in this fashion by elected officials who justify the hardships they impart upon black voters by calling those voters "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/why-pennsylvanias-vote-suppressors-can-never-win/262809/">lazy</a>." By allowing this ugliness to endure, year after year, election after election, we don't just subvert our own democracy. We preclude ourselves from turning to the world and proclaiming that we respect the value of a single vote and the dignity of a single voter. We don't practice what we preach.<br /><br />And we ought to be talking about things now, before Tuesday, because when it's all over no one will care until the next election cycle, at which point it will likely be too late. Don't want to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57394298-503544/bill-introduced-to-move-election-day-to-weekend/">switch Election Day to a Saturday</a>? Fine. Don't want to make it a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/should-election-day-be-a-holiday/305082/">national holiday</a>? Fine. But doing nothing after the election of 2012 is not an honorable option. What's happening in these states is conclusive proof that America failed to solve the fundamental problems we all saw play out in Florida during the recount of 2000. That's just not good enough.<br /><br />I asked election-law specialist Rick Hasen, who <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300182033">wrote the book</a> about all of this, for his view on the eve of another dubious election. He told me: "We need national nonpartisan election administration -- one that would pick rules that would allow all eligible voters, but only eligible voters, a fair chance to cast a ballot which will be accurately counted. It is national urgency but I don't see it happening any time soon. If Florida 2000 was not enough of a wake-up call, it is hard to imagine how much worse things would have to get before they get better." <br /><br />But let us begin. Congress ought to pass a "Voters' Rights Act," which guarantees a mail-in option and ensures significant early-voting hours for 10 days before a federal election. That would give working people -- you know, the real "middle class" -- four full days over two weekends to cast their ballot. Congress also ought to expand the scope of the Voting Rights Act, the venerable civil-rights statute, to force local election officials everywhere in America (and not just in Southern jurisdictions) to justify restrictions on voting rights.<br /><br />And the next president, whoever he is, ought to quickly empanel another <a href="http://www1.american.edu/ia/cfer/report/report.html">Commission on Federal Election Reform</a> to investigate these partisan state schemes and recommend ways to achieve meaningful reform. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor should head that commission. And former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald should head up its investigative functions. <div><br /></div><div>But I won't hold my breath. If I'm around in 2016 I bet I'll be complaining about the same injustices. In my lifetime, little has changed in America but the forms of indignity we all seem to tolerate when it comes to another man's right to vote.<br /></div><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253e74d6/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=No+One+in+America+Should+Have+to+Wait+7+Hours+to+Vote&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fno-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote%2F264506%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=No+One+in+America+Should+Have+to+Wait+7+Hours+to+Vote&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fno-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote%2F264506%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572291/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253e74d6/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658572291/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253e74d6/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658572291/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253e74d6/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/g4dnuqb5HMc" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253e74d6/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cno0Eone0Ein0Eamerica0Eshould0Ehave0Eto0Ewait0E70Ehours0Eto0Evote0C26450A60C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Shame on the Republicans Who Curtailed Early Voting</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/ZqHnUJahUd0/story01.htm</link><description>Hours-long election lines stretching many city blocks are a national embarrassment.

For people whose jobs, child-care obligations, or other commitments make it difficult or impossible to reach the polls on Election Day, the opportunity to vote early extends the franchise. Spreading out voting over more days makes lines at the polls shorter, benefiting citizens. It also makes the election less vulnerable to unexpected events, like bad weather, broken voting machines, or terrorist attacks, that could conceivable disrupt things on a single Tuesday. Finally, states that permit voting on Sundays make it easier for churchgoers to participate in "Souls to the Polls" events, where congregations exercise their franchise together after services, walking or carpooling together to their polling place. So why not expand early voting?<br /><br />In 2008, high voter demand suggested more hours open, more polling places, and more poll workers were needed. Instead, Republicans in several contested states have fought to restrict early voting, sometimes successfully. (Did I mention that "Souls to the Polls" mostly happens in black churches?) <br /><br />Let's quickly survey the results of their recent efforts:  <br /><ul><li>"With complaints streaming in from angry voters, the Florida Democratic Party and the League of Women Voters asked Gov. Rick Scott and state election officials on Thursday to extend early voting. They argued that some voters were leaving without voting because they did not have all day to wait in line. The Monroe County election supervisor, Harry Sawyer, also asked Mr. Scott to use his emergency powers to extend early voting. But the governor and state elections officials turned down the request, saying that the process was running smoothly and that the move was unnecessary. Last year, Mr. Scott and the Republican-controlled Legislature pushed through a measure to cut early voting from 14 days to 8 days and to cancel voting on the final Sunday before Election Day." -- <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/democrats-sue-to-extend-floridas-early-voting/"><i>The New York Times</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>"In a work-around to an early-voting crackdown law, the Miami-Dade elections headquarters will open Sunday afternoon to allow voters to request and cast absentee ballots in person. The elections department announced the change Sunday morning, after the Florida Democratic Party filed a lawsuit in the wee hours seeking to somehow extend voting in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties before Election Day. A spokeswoman said the department made the decision Saturday night after seeing such long early voting lines -- the last voter wasn't checked in until 1 a.m. Voters in line at 7 p.m. Saturday were allowed to vote." -- <i><a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2012/11/miami-dade-will-allow-in-person-absentee-voting-at-its-headquarters-sunday.html">The Miami Herald</a></i></li></ul><ul><li>"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Early voters jammed county election boards across Ohio Sunday on the last weekend day before the election in a state where that presidential election may well be decided. At some sites, lines snaked several city blocks and it took hours for voters to get inside to cast a ballot... In Cleveland, more than 2,500 people braved the cold in a line that stretched two blocks and started forming two hours before the doors opened, but moved quickly all afternoon... In Summit County, hundreds of<strong> </strong>people were in line at 4:30 p.m. in Akron and were waiting on average two hours to vote during an "extremely busy" afternoon, said board of elections deputy director Kim Zurz. In Painesville, east of Cleveland in Lake County, about 200 people were in line in the early afternoon, and voting was taking about two hours." -- <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/11/huge_turnout_long_lines_for_ea.html">The Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i></a> </li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.plunderbund.com/2012/11/04/scenes-of-early-voting-around-ohio/">Photos</a> of voting lines in Ohio. <br /></li></ul><ul><li>"AKRON, Ohio -- On Saturday afternoon, at 1:45 p.m., I belatedly realized that early voting ended in 15 minutes.

This is qualitatively different from the standard voter suppression efforts Republicans have focused on.

I shy away from un-American not because it is too harsh, but because the United States has an ugly tradition of partisans adopting measures knowing that they'll depress the ability of voters "on the other side" to be counted on Election Day.

But several readers report what they have seen. First, from a worried Democrat, about the McCaskill-Akin ("legitimate rape") Senate race:<br /><blockquote>I live in Missouri, and I just don't trust these polling leads McCaskill has (which are embarrassingly small as it is).  I think people may be embarrassed to tell pollsters they are supporting Akin (not necessarily claiming to support Claire, but perhaps being more likely to hang up on a pollster if they are pro-Akin).  <br /><br />I have a bad, bad feeling about this, but I hope I'm wrong--and not just because I like McCaskill (have met her several times) and think Akin would be a terrible senator.  Beyond all that usual level of politics, it would be a black mark on Missouri, really make us an object of ridicule, if we were to elect him after all this.  ::shudder::<br /></blockquote>For better or worse, we should all be past the "bad, bad feeling" stage, or its counterpart "good, good feeling," in a few days.<br /><br />Now, from a more buoyant-sounding Democrat in Virginia:<br /><blockquote>If it comes down to the "ground game," I think Obama has this all sewn up.  I live in northern Virginia (a "battleground state").  Yesterday, someone knocked on my door and asked for my Mom (who lives with me).  I asked what it was about, and he said he was from the Democratic party and wanted to make sure she had a ride to her voting location on Tuesday (she's 89).  When I said yes, she lived with me and that we would both be sure to vote on Tuesday (the straight Democratic ticket), he made a notation on his checklist, thanked us, and went on his way.  Then today, a second canvasser came by to make sure we voted.  I don't remember for sure, but I don't think we were visited by a canvasser 4 years ago, let alone two.<br /><br />I now very much believe the reports I've read about Obama's vaunted ground game.  One can always hope.<br /></blockquote>And from a fairly recent arrival in Washington, D.C., explaining this photo that he took last night:<br /><br /><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/vote_line.jpg"><img alt="vote_line.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/vote_line-thumb-620x463-104163.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="463" width="620" /></a><br /><br /><blockquote>- As it happens, I just voted this evening [Saturday night], and on a voting machine. I too had the alarming experience of trying to check my candidate and having the machine select someone else instead. I was able to change it back easily enough, and there was a visible paper trail being printed for every step I took (vote for wrong candidate --> attempt to select my candidate and receive error message because I have to de-select the selection--> de-select wrong candidate --> vote for my candidate). Moreover, it was plainly visible and there was a final step for reviewing and revising all selections made. Anyone who after that still voted for the wrong person wasn't paying attention.<br /><br />- It's bad that the touch screen technology doesn't seem to have caught up with our smart phones, but the much bigger scandal to me was the two hours I had to wait in line just to cast the bloody ballot, particularly when early voting is supposed to make the process easier. Attached is a photo of the line just after I finished voting. It snaked to the back of the building, up front, and then back up the stairs. It was slightly shorter than when I started, when the line was coming back down the stairs. It's frankly appalling that in the second decade of the 21st century the electoral process have the efficiency of a gasoline rationing, and in the nation's capitol no less. (I live in Ward 7, one of DC's poorer areas. I consider the intersection of poverty and voting restrictions a product of gross negligence at best.)..<br /><br />I get the feeling that early voting is less of a hassle in the much more affluent Northwest quadrant as it is where I'm living and that in five or ten years, when Southeast has been colonized by wealthier (and mostly whiter) citizens, things here will begin to change. <br /> </blockquote><div>Again, that the world's leading democracy has such shoddy machinery of democracy should be embarrassing -- and we haven't even gotten to Florida. More soon. <br />___<br />(And, of course, the other D.C. ground-game development is that the Redskins looked pathetic in their loss to the previously pathetic-seeming Panthers.

One model is that reminders of the possibility of our own death, especially after September 11 and other terrorist attacks, push voters toward candidates perceived as more authoritative. While the evolutionary roots of the phenomenon and the role of the fear of death have been <a href="http://www.cdnresearch.net/pubs/kirknav.pdf">questioned</a>, the effect itself appears strong. Even some prominent liberal academics have accepted this view. Thus Cass Sunstein, a professor of law at Harvard and until August administrator of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/science/earth/cass-sunstein-to-leave-top-regulatory-post.html">White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a>, wrote in a <a href="http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2006/10/mortality_salie.html">blog post in 2006</a> while at the University of Chicago:<br /><blockquote>Democrats would like to think that the situation is very different now from what it was in 2004, and that the issue of terrorism may even work in their favor. With the war in Iraq apparently going badly, perhaps a reminder of the September 11 attacks no longer has the effect that it had even two years ago. It's possible, but there is reason for doubt. There has been no successful attack on the United States in the last five years, and it remains true that Republican candidates have been able to project greater firmness, aggression, and resolve. If the 2004 data predict behavior, nontrivial numbers of undecided, moderate, and even liberal voters will be moved in the Republican direction by any news about terrorism -- whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. The electoral results in 2006 and 2008 will depend, in large part, on whether the underlying dynamics are changed.<br /></blockquote>Two years later the 2008 election, in which a candidate with no military record defeated an older authority figure with an undisputed record of wartime heroism, seemed to suggest at the very least that economic anger and fear -- even in the absence of many identifiable deaths -- trumped existential anxiety. How well has the mortality salience theory held up? If we judge from the best single barometer of political chances, the <a href="http://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/graphs/graph_Pres12_WTA.cfm">Iowa Electronic Markets</a> (I've argued for this status <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/so-what-do-the-political-odds-markets-say-about-the-election/262332/">here</a>) neither the May 2012 killing of Osama bin Laden nor the September 2012 terrorist attack on the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>consulate in Benghazi, Libya, produced a marked change in odds like the decline of President Obama's chances after the first debate. (Day-by-day numbers are available on the <a href="http://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/pricehistory/pricehistory_SelectContract.cfm?market_ID=351"><span class="caps">IEM </span>site</a>.) <br /><br />There has been a significant improvement in Obama's chances against Romney in the <span class="caps">IEM </span>since Superstorm Sandy made landfall on October 29, resulting in at least known 110 deaths by now, from closing ratios of 62-38 on October 28 to 69-28 at the end of Thursday, November 1, on the eve of the employment report. (They don't add up to 100 because contracts on each candidate's chances are sold independently.) <br /><br />The president's further boost after Sandy isn't due just to the perception that he and his administration have performed well. It also may reflect a bipartisan tendency of voters to choose the security of a known incumbent against a challenger. It would have worked just as strongly for a Republican, although it's worth nothing that the engineer, entrepreneur, and technocrat Herbert Hoover made his reputation as a "master of emergencies" and in many ways still has the most impressive pre-White House <a href="http://hoover.archives.gov/info/HooverBio.html">managerial CV</a> of any American president. The historian David Welky, in his excellent recent book <i><a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/books/excerpt/2012/welky_thousand-year.html">The Thousand-Year Flood</a></i>, on the Mississippi-Ohio crisis of 1937 (which I reviewed <a href="http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/blog/index.cfm/Current_Books/2011/10/26/water-over-the-bridge">here</a>), criticizes missed opportunities but reminds Republicans and Democrats alike what an immediate political success Franklin Roosevelt's flood control policies proved to be in terms of helping to legitimize the big government that Mr. Romney deplores:<br /><blockquote>Although previous administrations had put charities and local groups in charge of relief and rehabilitation matters, Franklin Roosevelt's New  Deal placed federal authorities at the center of national affairs. Americans now looked to their president rather than to a governor or mayor. Administration officials saw the flood as an opportunity to showcase their philosophy of government.<br /></blockquote>We might even turn around the famous 1970s remark of the Philadelphia Mayor <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/17/obituaries/frank-rizzo-of-philadelphia-dies-at-70-a-hero-and-villain.html">Frank Rizzo </a>that a conservative is a liberal who was mugged the night before. Perhaps a big-government fan is a classical liberal waiting in the cold and dark for the power to come back on. <img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25388635/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Will+Fear+of+Death+Give+Obama+a+New+Lease+on+Life%3F&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fwill-fear-of-death-give-obama-a-new-lease-on-life%2F264505%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Will+Fear+of+Death+Give+Obama+a+New+Lease+on+Life%3F&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fwill-fear-of-death-give-obama-a-new-lease-on-life%2F264505%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658548963/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25388635/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658548963/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25388635/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658548963/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25388635/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/EFIjCy4idTw" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25388635/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cwill0Efear0Eof0Edeath0Egive0Eobama0Ea0Enew0Elease0Eon0Elife0C26450A50C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Today's Ignoramus-Nation Moment: 'Best Revenge'</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/p1hOhombGGE/story01.htm</link><description>The unbelievable cynicism and know-nothingness of the 'vote for revenge' attack ads<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2536ecc5/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Today%27s+Ignoramus-Nation+Moment%3A+%27Best+Revenge%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Ftodays-ignoramus-nation-moment-best-revenge%2F264502%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Today%27s+Ignoramus-Nation+Moment%3A+%27Best+Revenge%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Ftodays-ignoramus-nation-moment-best-revenge%2F264502%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2012 15:27:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-04:mt-264502</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/REMLiving.thumb.jpg" /><dc:creator>James Fallows</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/LivingWell2.png"><img alt="LivingWell2.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/LivingWell2-thumb-350x512-104143.png" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" height="512" width="350" /></a>In the final two days of the campaign, the Romney-Ryan ticket and its supporters are all over President Obama for talking about "revenge." On Friday, when trying to shush supporters who were booing the mention of Mitt Romney's name, Obama said they shouldn't boo -- they should vote. Because, as he said in an ad-libbed line, "voting is the best revenge." <br /><br />In the eyes of the right, that line is the offense -- and apparently they're not kidding. Fox News was immediately on it as <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/mitt-romney/2012/11/03/obama-vote-revenge-romney-vote-love-country">the latest election-changing gaffe</a> and outrage. And here's a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-romney-highlights-obama-remark-on-voting-as-best-revenge-20121103,0,3791003.story">sample from</a> a Romney stump speech yesterday that then was included in an ad:<br /><blockquote>Yesterday, the president .. told his supporters, voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: Vote for love of country!"<br /></blockquote>The Fox Nation headline was "Obama: Vote for 'Revenge,' Romney: Vote for Love of Country.' " <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/FoxRevenge-thumb-400x234-104152.png"><img alt="Thumbnail image for FoxRevenge.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/FoxRevenge-thumb-400x234-104152-thumb-300x175-104153.png" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" height="175" width="300" /></a><br />No doubt the Romney campaign felt that it had caught Obama in an on-the-record version of the "clinging to guns and religion" line four years ago. Finally we get a real look at the guy, and what we see is someone who, like his mentor Rev. Jeremiah Wright, (a) doesn't love his country, and (b) is showing traits of that unsettling "angry black man-ism" that he usually manages to conceal so shrewdly behind his cool manner and big smile. <br /><br />Of course, what we're actually seeing is the entirely different option (c): That Obama is so familiar with bookclub-level literary allusions (in this case the aphorism "living well is the best revenge"), rather than anything super highbrow, that he (c1) recognizes them as cliches or formulas that can be adapted, and (c2) assumes that at least some other people will also recognize them as such. <br /><br />Illustration of point (c1) concerning language so familiar it can be adapted: In the first season of <i>Homeland</i>, the Brody family is taking a drive from the D.C. area to Gettysburg. They've just been discussing "Four-score and seven years ago..." One of the kids asks how far they still have to drive. The mother says, "Three-score miles." In the circumstances of that car, this also illustrates (c2).<br /> <br />When it comes to Obama's off-hand remark, I have exactly zero doubt that he thought he was applying a widely familiar term. That is what anyone of his age, background, and education would have had in mind. Let me put it this way: Last night, in an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/03/164186569/taylor-swift-my-confidence-is-easy-to-shake">NPR interview</a> with Guy Raz, Taylor Swift, who is all of 22, was discussing poems by Pablo Neruda. Is it so surprising that a sitting president, who is nearly three decades older than Swift and, unlike her, a college and law-school grad and author of a memoir packed with literary allusions, would have heard the very familiar saying "living well is the best revenge"? And would know that it doesn't mean anything like what Romney claimed. [<b>Update</b>: a number of people have written in saying, "Ok, what does it mean?" That's why I have the links below to Calvin Tomkins's article and other references. Look it up! Or listen to R.E.M. Short answer: it is about the opposite of "revenge" in the normal sense.] [And another <b>update</b>: This post's title is obviously exaggerated for effect, and I am not saying that anyone unfamiliar with "living well..." is an ignoramus. I am saying that the Romney campaign certainly knows what Obama was saying, and why -- and the ad suggesting otherwise is pandering to know-nothingism.]<br /><br />Bonus question: is it possible that Mitt Romney himself -- who went to Stanford and then BYU, who lived in France, who went to Harvard Business School and like Obama to Harvard Law, who has lived for decades in Boston and considers himself well-read and has some literarily accomplished advisors -- has never heard of this saying? Is it conceivable that he actually believes Obama was talking about revenge-voting as if it were basically like "revenge sex"?<br /><br />Just to show that familiarity with the phrase is not confined to people interested in F. Scott Fitzgerald; or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_and_Sara_Murphy">Gerald and Sara Murphy</a>, the arty American exiles in France who were supposedly the model for Dick and Nicole Diver in <i>Tender Is the Night</i> and were the subjects of Calvin Tompkins's very popular book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Well-Revenge-Modern-Library/dp/0679603085"><i>Living Well Is the Best Revenge</i></a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1962/07/28/1962_07_28_031_TNY_CARDS_000267984">New Yorker article</a>; nor even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert">George Herbert</a>, the English poet who 400-plus years ago coined the term "living well is the best revenge," I give you R.E.M.:<br /><br /><img alt="REMLiving.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/REMLiving.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="348" width="411" /><br /> <div><br />Plus:<br /><br /><img alt="Living_Well_Is_The_Best_Revenge.jpeg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/Living_Well_Is_The_Best_Revenge.jpeg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="278" width="280" /><br /><br />Bonus-bonus question: Why are reporters outside the Fox News ecosystem reporting this "controversy" at face value? E.g., <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/romney-camp-pounces-on-presidents-revenge-remark-obama-camp-calls-it-scare-tactics/">from ABC News</a>:<br /><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/RevengeABC.png"><img alt="RevengeABC.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/RevengeABC-thumb-600x211-104150.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="211" width="600" /></a><br /></div><div><br />I am going to town on this because it's the end of the election cycle, and I don't know whether to laugh or cry* about this latest glimpse into our public culture. Maybe I will escape these next two days by watching football. Or opening <i>Tender is the Night</i> for the first time since college. <br />__<br />* Not really! This is a cliche that I am using on purpose. In real life I am sitting here drinking some coffee.<br /><br />And <b>one more update</b>! Fox goes all in, saying that Obama "coined a new campaign catchphrase":<br /><br /><img alt="Fox2ad.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/Fox2ad.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="397" width="458" /><br /></div><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2536ecc5/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Today%27s+Ignoramus-Nation+Moment%3A+%27Best+Revenge%27&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Ftodays-ignoramus-nation-moment-best-revenge%2F264502%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Today%27s+Ignoramus-Nation+Moment%3A+%27Best+Revenge%27&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Ftodays-ignoramus-nation-moment-best-revenge%2F264502%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658542692/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536ecc5/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/p1hOhombGGE" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2536ecc5/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Ctodays0Eignoramus0Enation0Emoment0Ebest0Erevenge0C26450A20C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Life in Ohio, Center of the Political Universe</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/43Sf68AqJcE/story01.htm</link><description>Voters in America's most significant swing state are ready for the presidential race to be over -- but the candidates won't leave them alone.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2536e26c/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Life+in+Ohio%2C+Center+of+the+Political+Universe&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Flife-in-ohio-center-of-the-political-universe%2F264500%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Life+in+Ohio%2C+Center+of+the+Political+Universe&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Flife-in-ohio-center-of-the-political-universe%2F264500%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658541326/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536e26c/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658541326/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536e26c/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658541326/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2536e26c/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2012 14:14:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-04:mt-264500</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Reuters</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/romneyetna.thumb.reuters.jpg" /><dc:creator>Molly Ball</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Voters in America's most significant swing state are ready for the presidential race to be over -- but the candidates won't leave them alone.</em> </p><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/romneyetna.banner.reuters.jpg"><img alt="romneyetna.banner.reuters.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/assets_c/2012/11/romneyetna.banner.reuters-thumb-615x300-104139.jpg" width="615" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a><div class="credit" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #242b30; margin: -3px 0 0 0; padding: 0; font-size: 9px; text-align:right ">Reuters</div><p> ETNA, Ohio -- People in Ohio are just like you and me: They can't wait for this presidential campaign to end. </p><p> "Let's just say we're pretty sick of all the ads, all the phone calls. We've had enough!" Paula Dillon, a 50-year-old teacher's aide at a high school in this Columbus suburb, told me. The robocalls pile up on her home answering machine: six, seven, 10 a day. "I don't listen to any of it anymore," she said. "I just hit erase." </p><p> As Election Day draws nigh, the major sentiment of the American people appears to be not excitement or jubilation or even nervousness -- it is exhaustion. Last week, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjrthOPLAKM">video</a> of a 4-year-old girl crying because, she told her mother, she was "tired of Bronco Bama and Mitt Romney" became a nationwide sensation, attracting millions of views and prompting National Public Radio, the source of the election news that so distressed Abigael Evans, to apologize to the youngster. </p><p> At Romney's campaign rallies Friday, the crowd chanted, "Four more days!" -- looking forward to the president's comeuppance, but also seeming eager for the sheer end of the campaign. "Absolutely, I can't wait for it to end," said 47-year-old Jim Snyder, a pharmacist from Reynoldsburg, who is still being inundated with campaign mail and phone calls even though he voted days ago. "It's just way, way too much." </p><p> The candidates, each of whom is plane-hopping to four states a day in these final days, seem exhausted. Romney, generally an early-to-bed type, landed in New Hampshire at 1 a.m. Friday night/Saturday morning, a slumbering grandson draped over his shoulder; by 8:50 a.m., he was back on his feet, headed for the day's first campaign rally. Obama began his day at FEMA headquarters in Washington at 8 a.m. Saturday, was in Cleveland by 11:30, and would see Wisconsin, Iowa, and Virginia before the day was over past midnight. </p><p> Naturally, no one is sicker of it than the press. "I have talked to <em>so many</em> Ohio voters," one longtime member of the Romney press corps groaned as we met at Romney's rally here, which drew about 2,500 to a cavernous sheet-metal warehouse. "I just want to go home," another said through chattering teeth at Romney's Friday night mega-rally outside Cincinnati. On the Romney bus the next day, a grateful press corps found vials of 5-Hour Energy waiting on their seats. </p><p> But it is the residents of the Buckeye State, America's swing state on steroids, who bear the brunt of election overload. "You've already been here twice!" a man told 28-year-old Teamsters member Jennifer Knapmeyer when she came to his door looking for his housemates Saturday afternoon. "You know they're going to vote!" But they hadn't voted yet, Knapmeyer sighed as she walked away, so they could count on one or two more visits a day through Tuesday. </p><p> "We are sure going to miss the 9,000 TV ads every day," Shannon Burns, a Cleveland-based Republican consultant, said sarcastically. (About $150 million has been spent on television in the presidential race in Ohio.) Ohioans never have to travel to see presidential candidates these days, he noted: "If you just stay in one place in this state, they'll be there sooner or later." </p><p> Indeed, in the last days of the campaign, Ohio would see Romney Friday (twice), Sunday and Monday, while the president toured three different Ohio cities Friday and would set foot in a different part of the state each of the last three days of the campaign. On Sunday, the two nominees and their running mates were all scheduled to be campaigning in different parts of Ohio. On Monday, Obama was scheduled to bring along Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen. </p><p> The Ohioans, ready as they are for this to be over, are nonetheless troupers about the whole deal. They keep coming out to see the candidates, even after they've done their duty and voted. They are good listeners and cheerful partisans. The candidates are always careful to include shout-outs to the importance of the state -- "Your state is the one I'm counting on, by the way," Romney said, "it's the one I need to win!" -- and these lines, often the only quotations that make it into the report on the local news or in the local paper, flatter Ohioans' pride. </p><p> "This is the heartland," Larry McCullough, a 65-year-old from Loveland, told me when I asked if it was fair for one state to so monopolize the presidential race. "We're the 'Mother of Presidents.' It's the natural order." (McCullough and his wife got rid of their land line after the 2010 election -- too many political calls.) </p><p> Why are Americans so sick of the campaign, anyway? Isn't democracy a wonderful thing? Are political commercials so much worse than, say, detergent commercials? Sure, there's a lot of negativity and strife, but we are also a nation that eagerly tunes in to television shows where people eat bugs and women compete for the affections of marginal celebrities. You don't hear people moaning around the water cooler that they can't wait for the NFL or American Idol season to be over already. The nation that created Ultimate Fighting, because old-fashioned boxing was not violent enough, suddenly becomes timid and sensitive at the prospect of elected officials calling each other names, and demands to be left alone. </p><p> Not everyone is such a shrinking violet. Joelle Forgrave, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mother in Blacklick, attended her second Romney rally in as many weeks here on Friday, bringing her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter and 14-month-old son. She still remembers when she was a little girl and her dad took her to a Reagan reelection rally; she hopes she's making the same kind of memories for her daughter. </p><p> Seeing Romney in person was inspiring both times, Forgrave said, but she wasn't looking forward to turning on the television.

This early copy from the Associated Press offered a hint: <blockquote>COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Voter advocates are criticizing an order by Ohio's elections chief dealing with the casting of provisional ballots. Advocates are saying on Saturday that the order by Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted late Friday wrongly puts the burden of recording the form of ID used on a provisional ballot on voters, not pollworkers ....</blockquote><p class="MsoNormal">Here's what happened. On Thursday, voting-rights advocates filed an "emergency motion" with a federal trial judge seeking his reassurance that provisional ballots in Ohio will be judged by the standard he endorsed (and Ohio reportedly agreed to) in a recent consent decree. That standard, the plaintiffs say, is "that a provisional-ballot form that has incomplete or improperly completed information regarding the type of identification proffered by a voter should be counted pursuant" to Ohio law, which, they say, makes the poll worker responsible for taking down the information. <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-01-346-Emergency-Motion-for-Clarification.pdf">Here's a link to that motion</a>. <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Ohio has not yet responded to it with a filing in court -- the state's deadline is Monday. But it was a full day <i>after</i> this motion was filed that the secretary of state, at 6 p.m. on the Friday before the election, issued his contrary directive, the text of which you can read in <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/11/03/1134981/last-minute-ohio-directive-could-trash-legal-votes-and-swing-the-election/">this timely piece by Judd Legum</a>. The issuance of the directive in turn prompted lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case to go back to U.S. District Judge <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/SEIU-1026-opinion.pdf">Algenon Marbley</a> with an even more urgent request, filed late Friday evening: </p><blockquote>This new Directive makes an affirmative change to the previous provisional ballot counting standard, beyond what was required to comply with this Court's and the Sixth Circuit's recent orders. Instead, contrary to this Court's October 26, 2012 decision, the Secretary's representations to this Court on October 24, 2012, and the Constitution, the Secretary is now ordering that county boards of election must reject provisional ballots when the identification information contained in Step 2 of the ballot affirmation form 12-B is incomplete.</blockquote> <p class="MsoNormal">The contours of the legal dispute aren't narrowing, as some legal disputes do at this stage of an election contest, but instead are growing. They are growing because the secretary of state has just doubled down on his position about incomplete provisional ballots. If he was wrong on Thursday, you could say, he was even more wrong on Friday. And that will likely mean a Monday ruling* from Judge Marbley which will then be appealed into Tuesday (and beyond) to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Folks, <i>the legal fight for Ohio's votes is already here and here to stay. </i><a href="http://dispatchpolitics.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2012/11/3-november-2012---emergency-court-motion.html">Here</a> from <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> are the money quotes: </p><blockquote>"The bottom line is that (Secretary of State Jon Husted) designed a form that violates Ohio law by improperly shifting to voters the poll workers' information-recording responsibilities regarding ID to voters, and then he wants to trash votes where there is a problem with the form on the section he misassigned to voters," said Cleveland attorney Subodh Chandra, who filed the motion .... <p></p><p> Husted spokesman Matt McClellan said the Friday directive actually was designed to concur with the Oct. 26 order of U.S. District Court Judge Algenon Marbley in a legal dispute over provisional ballots. "We wanted to make sure we complied with those directions," McClellan said. Voters will complete the same form they did in the March primary and August special elections. We're not doing anything new," he said. "Voters have to provide ID when they vote provisionally."</p></blockquote> This dispute is important for many reasons. First, it's probably the most direct evidence yet that Ohio will be counting its provisional ballots for days or even weeks past Tuesday. The blossoming argument above assumes as it must that there will be a great deal of anxious vote counting after Election Day. This scenario hasn't exactly been a secret. But here's an actual live dispute for us all to watch. It's also a reminder that anyone rooting for a resolution Tuesday night (or early Wednesday) ought to hope that it doesn't all come down to Ohio. If it does, it will be weeks -- and one judicial hearing after another -- before we have an answer.<br /><p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The motion also is important for what it says these days about Husted and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/say-hello-to-the-ohio-official-who-might-pick-the-next-president/264201/">the way he is running the state's elections</a>. Leaving aside the provisional ballot court fight for a moment, Saturday's early voting period was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/ohioans-line-up-for-early-voting-in-the-battleground-state/2012/11/03/166be598-25e7-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html">hectic</a>, largely because Husted and his fellow Republicans succeeded this cycle in reducing the number of early-voting weekends from five to one. Indeed, they tried to eliminate all such early voting, which traditionally helps wage earners who can't vote during regular business hours on weekdays, but were rejected in this effort by the federal courts. <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">What does it mean on the ground and to the exercise of a registered voter's right to vote? From <i>The Washington Post </i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/ohioans-line-up-for-early-voting-in-the-battleground-state/2012/11/03/166be598-25e7-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html">late Saturday</a>: "In Cuyahoga, 36,578 had voted as of Friday; in 2008, that number was 54,340. In 2008, there were nine additional early voting days here, and 9,933 people voted on those days." And Husted? While I was searching for the above copy I found another Associated Press story, also dated Saturday, which noted: "Husted says in a statement that voting has gone smoothly in Ohio and he expects absentee voting this year to surpass 2008."</p> <br /> <p>*We are now being told the deadline for the State's submission is late Tuesday, with reply briefs due from the plaintiffs on November 8 and a written order from the judge to follow. Even more reason to realize that if the election comes down to Ohio it will be a while before we know who has won.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25346a13/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Ohio%27s+Provisional+Ballot+Order%3A+The+Biggest+Legal+Story+of+the+Weekend&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fohios-provisional-ballot-order-the-biggest-legal-story-of-the-weekend%2F264498%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Ohio%27s+Provisional+Ballot+Order%3A+The+Biggest+Legal+Story+of+the+Weekend&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fohios-provisional-ballot-order-the-biggest-legal-story-of-the-weekend%2F264498%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658532094/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25346a13/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658532094/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25346a13/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658532094/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/25346a13/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/u4GUbIGb2s4" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/25346a13/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cohios0Eprovisional0Eballot0Eorder0Ethe0Ebiggest0Elegal0Estory0Eof0Ethe0Eweekend0C2644980C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>And If the GOP Doesn't Win, What Then?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/dA4FZq8SvRM/story01.htm</link><description>A struggle for the future of a party, no matter how things go three days from now<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2533df61/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=And+If+the+GOP+Doesn%27t+Win%2C+What+Then%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fand-if-the-gop-doesnt-win-what-then%2F264495%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=And+If+the+GOP+Doesn%27t+Win%2C+What+Then%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fand-if-the-gop-doesnt-win-what-then%2F264495%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658530340/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2533df61/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658530340/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2533df61/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658530340/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2533df61/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2012 03:01:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-03:mt-264495</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Reuters</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/karlrove.hero.reuters.jpeg" /><dc:creator>James Fallows</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nobody knows what's going to happen on Tuesday. (<i>11 p.m. Saturday update:</i> But watching a completely-losing-his-voice Bill Clinton do a barnburner in his intro for Barack Obama in Virginia, I'm seeing an episode of Democratic "momentum.") (And nice line in return from Obama just now: "The only Clinton workin' harder than him is our Secretary of State.") <br /><br />But let's do a thought experiment and assume that current probabilities hold. That would mean that Barack Obama is reelected; the Romney-Ryan ticket is defeated; and even as the Republicans begin assessing their promising next tier of Christie-Rubio-Jindal-maybe Ryan-maybe Jeb Bush candidates for 2016, they confront two discouraging realities. One is not having been able to beat a marginally popular president during a time of widespread economic distress. The other is seeing several big demographic blocs -- Latinos, blacks, women -- moving away from them.<br /><br />What then? We're getting ahead of ourselves, but as a distraction here are several messages from readers. First, from someone in the aviation world:<br /><blockquote>Presuming Mr. Obama does indeed win, I think the more interesting question is what will the Republican party do to regroup?... <br /><br />The question in my mind is "is this the end of the Karl Rove Party?"  He pioneered the strategy of shifting the party right to get an energized "base," also shifting it toward the new Know-Nothings they've become. [JF note: Rove and GWB also were careful to try to include Latinos as part of a new GOP big tent. That worked for them in Texas but has not lasted with their Tea Party-era, Tancredo-toned successors, which could prove one of the party's lasting vulnerabilities.]<br /><br />It hasn't won.  Laura Ingraham's "if the GOP can't beat Obama with this economy, shut it down" strikes me as unintentionally prophetic.  The economy is now improving, Obama will never run again, and demographic trends are certainly against the current Republican message. What will the Republicans do?<br /><br />The existence of the Tea Party faction makes this a nasty problem -- any attempt by Republicans to pivot toward the mainstream will cost them factional challenges, perhaps third-party rightist candidates on the ballot.<br /></blockquote>Extending the last argument, a reader in Pennsylvania writes:<br /><blockquote>I can't pretend to know what motivates folks like Karl Rove, but I can say with certainty, as a Democratic committeeperson here in suburban Philly, that one thing that does motivate the Democratic ground game here in Pennsylvania is the sense that an Obama victory and some key US Senate victories for Democrats could lead to the splitting apart of the Republican Party, with a possible 3rd Party movement on the right getting legs.  <br /><br />As Democrats we see that possible development as an obvious opening for us to pick up more Democratic victories down ballot in the next two or three elections here in PA and also in some red states.   This "long term" perspective is a very tangible motivator as we all participate in GOTV efforts here in PA over the next 3 days.  <br /><br />On a final note, in the midst of all the challenges facing America right now, any long drawn out effort to delegitimize Obama victory through Congress, in particular, will, in my humble opinion, only benefit Democrats in the mid-terms.  <br /></blockquote>And from a reader in California:<br /><blockquote>As we come down to the wire, I sticking with my premise/intuition that 1972 will repeat in 2012.<br /><br />The only doubt is whether the Dems can regain enough seats to take the house. [JF note: I am chary of predictions, but this seems very unlikely to me.] Otherwise, Obama wins well and the Senate holds, and gains a few, like Elizabeth Warren. [JF: pickups, like Warren over Brown, seem plausible at this point; net Democratic gains in the Senate a much longer shot.]<br /><br />From all that I've read, the moderate middle (i.e. that which is not counted as the base) will mostly go to Obama. That may not include older white men, but women and minorities will more than make up for them. This despite Republican efforts to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible by jiggering state voting rules.<br /><br />It's not that I have some special knowledge that others don't. But I've voted in every election but one since 1968, and what stands out strongly in my memory are what I call, for lack of better term, the extremist years, when one party leaned far much in one direction, which for the moderate middle was too far away from them.<br /></blockquote>Obviously, and unendurably, the "who looks good for the 2016 race???" speculation will rev up before we have even recovered from this cycle. I am explicitly not trying to get into next-<i>candidate</i> thinking on either side. But the next <i>identity</i> of the Republican party is what a lot of people will be wrestling with, no matter how things go in three days.

It isn't just about Republicans and Democrats or control of the Senate or electoral votes in swing states. All across the country, on ballots short and long, voters will make choices about some of the most important and contentious legal issues of our time. They will also choose Tuesday night to elect, retain, or dismiss some of the most controversial local officials of our time, folks whose impact upon the rule of law has been, or would be, profound.<br /><br />The biggest "legal" issue Tuesday night, of course, the one that could dwarf all these other issues in the short term, is the issue of voter fraud/vote suppression. After years of partisan legislation designed to make it harder for people to vote, and after months of state and federal court rulings protecting broader voting rights, we all soon will learn whether election officials in key states are willing and able to ensure that registered voters are able to vote, to vote accurately, and to have those votes counted fully and fairly.<br /><br />Soon we also will know whether the election is close enough to generate a recount in a state the electoral votes of which would determine the presidency. I think it's likely that we'll see a recount somewhere. The tougher question is whether such a recount will be dispositive as it was in Florida in 2000. There are many reasons to be concerned about this happening again. As the good folks at the Brennan Center for Justice <a href="http://brennan.3cdn.net/2880feece63eb67ef2_p0m6iopt8.pdf">note</a>, of all the recount procedures in battleground states, only New Hampshire requires hand-counting of ballots during a recount. <br /><br />But those are contingencies. Let's return to what we know voters will face. Before the details, a few quick observations. Guns are on the ballot only in <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Louisiana_Right_to_Bear_Arms,_Amendment_2_%282012%29">Louisiana</a>. Affirmative action is on the ballot only in <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Oklahoma_2012_ballot_measures">Oklahoma</a>. And the election of 2012 is notable for what <i>isn't</i> on the ballot. Unlike the election of 2010, for example, there are no "sharia law" provisions this year. Four such measures were introduced but rejected this cycle, probably because it became apparent after the 2010 election cycle that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/01/in-oklahoma-case-another-legal-obstacle-to-banning-sharia-law/251190/">such laws are patently unconstitutional</a>.<br /><br />Here now is a list of some of the law-related election battles I'll be following into Tuesday and beyond. After the votes are counted, I'll be back next week with a follow-up to share with you how these races turned out. If you have any suggestions for inclusion on this list by all means let me know with a comment below. I offer these in no particular order of significance.<br /><br /><b>1.</b> <b>California and the death penalty</b>. <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_34,_the_End_the_Death_Penalty_Initiative_%282012%29">Proposition 34</a> would end the state's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/its-time-for-california-to-end-its-death-penalty/263588/">costly and inefficient</a> experiment with capital punishment and transform all existing death penalties (725 in all) into life sentences without the possibility of parole. Passage would mean an annual savings to California taxpayers of approximately $130 million. <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-end-prop34-20121024,0,4120714.story">endorsed the change</a> and so have many legislators and law enforcement officials. There are national implications here, too. If the state with the largest death row in the nation turns away from capital punishment you can bet it won't be long before some federal judge, or Supreme Court justice, cites it as an "<a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/criminal_justice_section_newsletter/crimjust_juvjus_EvolvingStandards.authcheckdam.pdf">evolving standards of decency</a>" under Eighth Amendment law.<br /><br /><b><i>2.</i> Marijuana</b><i>. </i>Voters in six states will be voting on marijuana initiatives. In Arkansas and Masschusetts, voters will decide whether to legalize, regulate, and tax medical marijuana. In  Montana, voters will decide whether to repeal their 2004 medical-marijuana initiative. And in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon, voters will decide whether to legalize, regulate and tax recreational marijuana. Of the latter contests, the Colorado measure, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative,_Amendment_64_%282012%29">Amendment 64</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/will-a-marijuana-legalization-vote-help-obama-win-colorado/264435/">appears to have the best chance of passage</a>. None of these measures is technically legal under federal law but the Obama Administration <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50133577n">went on the record recently</a>, in a <i>60 Minutes </i>segment, pledging not to harass individual users.<br /><br /><b>3. Same-Sex Marriage</b>. Voters in three states -- Maryland, Maine and Washington -- will vote on same-sex marriage initiatives. In Maine, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maine_Same-Sex_Marriage_Question,_Question_1_%282012%29">the vote is to overturn or ratify</a> a 2009 measure that outlawed same-sex marriage. In Maryland, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maryland_Same-Sex_Civil_Marriage_Referendum,_Question_6_%282012%29">the vote is to affirm or reject</a> a new law permitting same-sex marriage. And in Washington, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Washington_Same-Sex_Marriage_Veto_Referendum,_Referendum_74_%282012%29">the vote is to endorse or preclude</a> a similar new law. These measures are important in their own right, of course, but they also are vital for what ammunition they will give lawyers and the justices in Washington, who are about to confront the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.*<br /><br /><b>4. Sheriff Joe Arpaio</b>. The most infamous lawman in America -- and longstanding sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona -- is heading toward yet another reelection victory. This despite <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=arpaio+scanda%3B&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=Etj&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22joe+arpaio%22+scandal&oq=%22joe+arpaio%22+scandal&gs_l=serp.3..0.18369.22746.0.23672.20.20.0.0.0.0.314.3796.0j15j4j1.20.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.LpBedVg9e0c&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=bc511441ea7da2f1&bpcl=37189454&biw=781&bih=429">a series</a> of recent political scandals, costly litigation and allegations of fiscal mismanagement. Over at <i>Mother Jones</i>, Timothy Murphy offers up <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/sheriff-joe-arpaio-paul-penzone-election-steven-seagal">an instant classic</a> on the race: <blockquote>Arpaio, meanwhile, has conducted his campaign more or less the same way he's run the MCSO for 20 years -- occasionally absent, punctuated by frenzied bursts of activity, and an enormous appetite for spending money. He's refused Penzone's offer to debate. His campaign website is Spartan. His campaign's listed phone number is actually the number for an insurance company (the site is out of date), which in turn directs you to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which, finally, refers you to the <a href="http://www.summitgroupnet.com/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Summit Group</a>, a Phoenix consulting firm run by a longtime confidant, which Arpaio's campaign has paid $1.8 million over the last year. In one of his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk_P5ScG3kg" target="_blank">television spots</a> (<a href="http://www.kpho.com/story/19799820/arpaio-ad-accuses-challenger-of-abusing-wife" target="_blank">another attacked Penzone</a> for a 2003 domestic complaint), Arpaio fidgets, unsmiling and uncomfortable, as his wife, Ava, explains why her husband shouldn't retire.</blockquote><p class="MsoNormal"><b>5. Judiciary</b><i>. </i>In four states closely aligned with Tea Party sentiment -- <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Arizona_Judicial_Selection_Amendment,_Proposition_115_%282012%29">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Judicial_Appointment_Amendment,_Amendment_3_%282012%29">Missouri</a>, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/New_Hampshire_State_Court_Amendment,_CACR_26_%282012%29">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Florida_Supreme_Court,_Amendment_5_%282012%29">Florida</a>-- conservative activists seek through ballot measures to limit judicial authority and independence through a series of partisan initiatives. The <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/state-court-justice-for-sale-or-rent/262791/">most blatant of these efforts</a> is in Florida, where Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-sponsored group, is seeking to remove three justices of the Florida Supreme Court. Millions have been spent on that race alone. Follow William Raftery's <a href="http://gaveltogavel.us/site/2012/10/23/special-election-night-coverage-hosted-by-gavel-to-gavels-bill-raftery/"><i>Gavel To Gavel</i></a> blog on election night if you want the play-by-play. <a href="http://www.ncsc.org/sitecore/content/microsites/gavel-to-gavel/home/2012-editions/Volume-6-Issue-33.aspx">Here</a> is his list of all judiciary-related amendments.<br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>6. Alabama segregation</b>. For the second time in eight years, voters in Alabama will have an opportunity to <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Alabama_Segregation_Reference_Ban_Amendment,_Amendment_4_%282012%29">delete from their state constitution an explicit reference to racial segregation</a> in public schools. The language currently on the books, a vestige of the state's <a href="http://www.educationjustice.org/states/alabama.html">dubious history of interposition</a>, states:</p><blockquote>To avoid confusion and disorder and to promote effective and economical planning for education, the legislature may authorize the parents or guardians of minors, who desire that such minors shall attend schools provided for their own race, to make election to that end, such election to be effective for such period and to such extent as the legislature may provide.</blockquote>It seems simple. <a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/view/full_story/20488879/article-Alabama-segregation-amendment-could-put--voters-in-a-bind?instance=home_news">But it's not</a>. Many Democrats and school administrators believe the initiative would <a href="http://www2.alabamas13.com/news/2012/oct/25/aea-fighting-amendment-4-racist-language-ar-4829510/">make matters worse</a>. And speaking of which, Alabama voters will get a chance again on Tuesday to choose or reject for the judiciary Roy Moore, the infamous former state supreme court justice <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/roy-and-his-rock/304264/">who once defied a federal court order</a> forcing him to remove the Ten Commandments monument he had ordered built at the state's supreme court.<br /><p class="MsoNormal"><b>7. Abortion</b>. In Florida, voters will confront <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Florida_Abortion,_Amendment_6_%282012%29#Text_of_the_measure">Amendment 6</a>, a measure that seeks to limit interpretation of the privacy rights contained in the state's constitution. In Montana, voters face LR-120, which involves <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Montana_Parental_Notification_Measure,_LR-120_%282012%29">parental-notification rules</a>. In Oklahoma, a "personhood" measure that would have criminalized abortion was <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/1029/Supreme-Court-turns-away-case-on-Oklahoma-personhood-amendment">rejected as unconstitutional</a> by the state's supreme court before it could make it onto the ballot. In case you were wondering, following a campaign where abortion and reproductive rights were issues, this isn't much different than 2010, when there were also three similiar measures (in Alaska, Colorado, and Missouri). <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>8. Health Care</b>. Silly you, you thought the Supreme Court's decision in June to uphold the Affordable Care Act meant the end of legal challenges to the federal health care law. Wrong. New litigation has been filed. And voters in five states -- <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Alabama_Health_Care_Amendment,_Amendment_6_%282012%29">Alabama</a>, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Florida_Health_Care,_Amendment_1_%282012%29">Florida</a>, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Health_Care_Exchange_Question,_Proposition_E_%282012%29">Missouri</a>, <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Montana_Health_Care_Measure,_LR-122_%282012%29">Montana</a> and <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Wyoming_Health_Care_Amendment,_Constitutional_Amendment_A_%282012%29">Wyoming</a> -- will have the opportunity on Tuesday to weigh in with their views of the obligations contained in the Care Act. The gist of each of these measures is made clear in the simple language of Wyoming's proposed <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Wyoming_Health_Care_Amendment,_Constitutional_Amendment_A_%282012%29#Text_of_measure">Amendment A</a>:</p><blockquote>The adoption of this amendment will provide that the right to make health care decisions is reserved to the citizens of the state of Wyoming. It permits any person to pay and any health care provider to receive direct payment for services</blockquote> <p class="MsoNormal"><b>9.</b> <b>Three-strikes</b>. Back to California for <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_36,_Changes_in_the_%22Three_Strikes%22_Law_%282012%29">Proposition 36</a>, which would reduce the scope of the state's notorious three-strikes law in an effort to clear overcrowded prisons there of more non-violent offenders. Like Proposition 34, the popularity of this initiative is owed perhaps as much to the budget savings the state would see from it as it is from the fact that the existing "three-strikes" law has resulted in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/opinion/three-strikes-of-injustice.html?_r=0">terrible injustice</a> to some Californians. If it passes -- and it was up in the polls the last time I checked -- it will be the clearest signal yet that states are serious about adjusting their views of the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/can-our-shameful-prisons-be-reformed/?pagination=false">harsh costs of our prison society</a>.</p><b>10. Death with dignity</b>. Voters in Massachusetts face <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Massachusetts_%22Death_with_Dignity%22_Initiative,_Question_2_%282012%29#Text_of_the_measure">Question 2</a>, which upon approval would mean a new state law "allowing a physician licensed in Massachusetts to prescribe medication, at the request of a terminally-ill patient meeting certain conditions, to end that person's life." The measure has been consistently in front in polling although its margin has <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/10/30/poll-backing-for-mass-question-slipping/0R2nDCqNipEBs91Ua6c5gM/story.html">slipped in the past few weeks</a>. It's an important moment for supporters of a "right to die." It's been long enough for them to have comforting research on how Oregon's landmark law has worked.

After all, most polling analysts and all the betting markets have President Obama as the favorite. But if you're like me -- an Obama supporter who for whatever perverse reason scans the horizon for glimmers of gloom -- you'll want to be in touch with the most plausible grounds for pessimism. I summarize them below. These worries may or may not be valid, but they're the best I've got.<br/><br/><b>1. Hurricane Sandy reverses course.</b> Karl Rove <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/02/hurricane-sandy-helped-obama-politically-karl-rove-says/">says</a> Sandy helped Obama by making him the "comforter-in-chief." And for the first 48 hours that did seem to be the story: Governor Chris Christie embraced him, Mayor Bloomberg endorsed him, and meanwhile Mitt Romney was found to have once <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/29/romney-fema-hurricane/1667059/">dissed</a> the idea of federal disaster relief. But here's something that occurred to me right around my 70th hour without electricity (which was restored around hour 75, I'm happy to say): The more time you spend without power, the more <img alt="Drudge.JPG" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/bobwright/Drudge.JPG" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" height="409" width="369" />frustrated and even angry you get, so by Tuesday we could have some very unhappy campers on our hands. Of course, the states hit hardest -- New Jersey, New York -- aren't swing states, but there was also damage in Pennsylvania, Virginia, even Ohio. And, anyway, national news coverage of the Sandy zone can convey a sense of chaos and incompetence that, justifiably or not, works against the incumbent. The <i>Drudge Report</i> (see the shot from its Friday night homepage on the right) is doing its best to further that cause. But even less ideological news outlets will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/slow-pace-of-recovery-from-hurricane-sandy-fuels-frustration-and-anger/2012/11/02/975281e2-2530-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html?hpid=z3"> tend to focus </a> on the parts of the storm recovery that aren't working. That's what journalism naturally does. (h/t: <a href="https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/264210674174029824">@blakehounshell</a>)<p></p> <p><b> 2. The national polls are right and the state polls are wrong.</b> There's a tension between polls being done at the state level -- mainly in swing states -- and the national polls. The former show Obama winning the electoral college, the latter show the popular vote being a tossup or maybe even going to Romney. Now, in principle it's possible that this discrepancy isn't a contradiction. Maybe Romney is "wasting" more votes with huge majorities in red states than Obama is "wasting" in less lopsided blue states -- so Obama has more votes "left over" for swing states. That's the way Obama could clearly win in the electoral college while roughly tying in, or even losing in, the popular vote. But Nate Silver of the <em>New York Times</em> recently <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/oct-30-what-state-polls-suggest-about-the-national-popular-vote/">provided reason</a> to think this isn't what's happening. He says it looks more like either the state polls or the national polls are just plain wrong. [<b><i>Update</i></b>, 11/4, 8:50 p.m.: Obama supporters will be happy to hear that new data is making Silver reconsider. This evening he <a href="https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/265249070422052864">tweeted</a>: "Everything gelling a bit: 1) US polls catching up to state polls 2) bad polls for BHO in noncompetitive states help explain remaining spread."] </p> <p> Silver thinks the state polls are more likely to be right than the national polls. But what if it's the other way around? What if the state polls are systematically wrong? Maybe owing to some methodological flaw that's more common among low-budget state-level pollsters? And maybe the impact of this flaw has been magnified by recent changes in demographics or in personal communications technology or whatever? Silver enlists a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/oct-30-what-state-polls-suggest-about-the-national-popular-vote/">chart</a> to show that national polls have often been more biased (i.e., systematically overstated either Democratic or Republican performance) than state polls. But the chart also shows that the last time national polls were markedly more biased than state polls was back in 2000 -- and in the most recent election national polls were ever-so-slightly <em>less </em>biased than state polls. Maybe this is a trend, and state polls are getting less and less reliable? I'm not saying this is the case. But as sources of anxiety go, it's not a bad one. Indeed, Silver <a href="http://http//fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nov-2-for-romney-to-win-state-polls-must-be-statistically-biased/">wrote</a> in a Saturday morning post that if his prediction of an Obama victory is wrong -- an outcome he gives a 16 percent probability -- it will almost certainly be because the state polls are wrong. </p> <p><b>3. The Bradley Effect </b>(named after former African-American mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley). Are some people reluctant to admit to pollsters that they're voting against a black candidate? If so, then both state and national polls could be overstating Obama's popular support. The conventional wisdom is that the Bradley Effect didn't amount to much in 2008, but Doug Wilder, former black governor of Virginia, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76274.html">thinks</a> it could be a factor in 2012. </p> <p><b>4. Benghazi.</b> Actually, even a worrier like me can't find much to worry about here. The conspiracy theory <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/26/cia-operators-were-denied-request-for-help-during-benghazi-attack-sources-say/">suggested</a> by Fox News -- that someone somewhere in the federal government ordered American security forces <em>not </em>to come to the rescue of Ambassador Chris Stevens and others in the Benghazi consulate -- <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83236.html">hasn't held up</a>. Romneyites have flogged the hell out of the Benghazi story, but I think that what little mileage they can get out of it they've already gotten. </p> <p> <em></em> </p> <p><b>5. Undecideds break against the incumbent in the final few days.</b> There's controversy over whether this tends to happen as a rule, but in any event it could presumably happen in any given year. Maybe, for example, "low-information voters" are particularly influenced by negative storm coverage or Benghazi conspiracy theories. But if so, they'd better hurry, because we've gone into the final weekend without any discernible movement toward Romney in the polls. </p> <p> OK, those are the main sources of worry I can generate at the moment. But I'll continue to seek signs of impending doom (or, if you're a Romney supporter, signs of emerging hope) and report back if I find any. As always, I'm optimistic about my chances of success.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253281cb/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Things+for+Obama+Supporters+to+Worry+About&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthings-for-obama-supporters-to-worry-about%2F264494%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Things+for+Obama+Supporters+to+Worry+About&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthings-for-obama-supporters-to-worry-about%2F264494%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658523866/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253281cb/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658523866/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253281cb/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658523866/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/253281cb/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/SoZgwHxL_hQ" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/253281cb/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cthings0Efor0Eobama0Esupporters0Eto0Eworry0Eabout0C2644940C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The 'Pre-Delegitimization' Watch: It Begins</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/hpViUKkLB_Q/story01.htm</link><description>Why American needs a new election system, argument #14,285<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/2531b5d1/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+%27Pre-Delegitimization%27+Watch%3A+It+Begins&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-pre-delegitimization-watch-it-begins%2F264493%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+%27Pre-Delegitimization%27+Watch%3A+It+Begins&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-pre-delegitimization-watch-it-begins%2F264493%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658546761/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2531b5d1/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658546761/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2531b5d1/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658546761/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/2531b5d1/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2012 16:52:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-03:mt-264493</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Screenshot</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/foxnewsdotcom.thumb.screenshot.jpg" /><dc:creator>James Fallows</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[In previous items <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/they-cant-both-be-right-savvy-experts-vs-polls/263997/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/how-can-that-be-more-on-the-they-cant-both-be-right-saga/264024/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/the-separate-realities-of-a-50-50-race/264427/">here</a>, I've mentioned the deeply conflicting versions of reality about how the vote will go three days from now:<br /><ul><li>Most state polls and polling aggregators show Barack Obama with a substantial lead.

Latest example in this category: Michael Barone, once known as a king-of-the-pre-quant-savants with the <i>Almanac of American Politics</i>, <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/barone-going-out-on-a-limb-romney-wins-handily/article/2512470">is now predicting</a> an easy Romney victory, with 315 electoral votes to Obama's 233. This involves Barone's calling the following states all for Romney: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Florida.<br /></li></ul>There are a variety of explanations for such fundamentally opposing views: wishful thinking on either side; media interest in a "down to the wire" race; morale-boosting on either side; and so on, including the residual explanation allowed by <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nov-2-for-romney-to-win-state-polls-must-be-statistically-biased/"><i>FiveThirtyEight</i> today</a>, that there may be some deep and systematic bias in all the state polls. But a reader yesterday suggested this explanation:<br /><blockquote>I, personally, absolutely believe [that the "Romney will win!" theme] is a de-legitimizing strategy...One can expect legal challenges if the vote is close.  I think this push to portray Obama as having zero chance is laying the groundwork.  At minimum it works to keep constituents of Republicans in Congress from tolerating any compromises in the event of an Obama re-election because they will have a reinforced sense of being robbed (which they have had about Mr. Kenya his whole presidency)....<br /></blockquote>Are we seeing any signs of this pre-delegitimizing approach? Surprisingly enough, one has appeared <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/02/claims-increasing-switched-votes-in-ohio/">on Fox News</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/FoxVotingMachine.png"><img alt="FoxVotingMachine.png" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2012/11/FoxVotingMachine-thumb-620x428-104128.png" class="mt-image-none" height="428" width="620" /></a></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>The story says:<br /><blockquote>Imagine going to vote for your presidential candidate and pushing the button on a touch-screen voting machine -- but the "X" marks his opponent instead.<br /><br />That is what some voters in Nevada, North Carolina, Texas and Ohio have reported.<br />Fox News has received several complaints from voters who say they voted on touch-screen voting machines -- only when they tried to select Mitt Romney, the machine indicated they had chosen President Obama. The voters in question realized the error and were able to cast ballots for their actual choice.<br /><br />"I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me," said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. <br />Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney ....<br /><br />Multiple voters from several states wrote Fox News to report problems similar to what Stevens reported.<br /><br />One voter asked: "I wonder how many voters just hit the 'Cast Ballot' without reading the machine?"<br /><br />"<b>How can we be sure our votes are not being stolen electronically?</b>" asked another. [Emphasis added.]<br /></blockquote>It's a natural question, especially if the information sources you rely on have convinced you that, were it not for fraud or cheating, Romney would be winning in a walk. It is worth starting to save up these reports -- and of course accounts of voter-suppression efforts.

In that time, I have been asked to make maybe a thousand predictions about legal events and issues, from the outcome of pending Supreme Court cases to the impeachment of a president to verdicts rendered by jurors in capital cases. I will never forget this moment: On March 31, 1997, on my first "official" day as a legal analyst for CBS Radio News, on the very first day of jury selection during the Oklahoma City bombing trial of Timothy McVeigh, I was asked on the air by a local reporter, "So, Andrew, is he going to be found guilty?"</p> <p>It's been like that ever since. Sometimes I have accurately predicted the outcomes of a trial. Sometimes I have been dead wrong. Many times, more so recently, I have refused to make a prediction at all, saying only that that there are too many random factors at play to make any sort of prediction worthy of much value to the rest of the world. The more I have learned about life and the law, in other words, the more I have come to understand how little I know about why certain things happen the way they do. I'd like to think that's the beginning of wisdom rather than just an acceptance of life's randomness.</p> <p>Predicting legal events, by rights, should be easier than predicting something as unwieldy as a national election. There are far fewer variables in play. There are only 12 jurors who deliberate in a capital case. There are only nine justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. There are only 100 senators who get to vote on a judicial nominee. There are only a handful of federal circuit courts. There is only one First Amendment. But just think, for example, about how many of us -- on all sides of the ideological spectrum -- were dead wrong this June about the justices and the Affordable Care Act? It's still more art than science.</p> <p>Political analysts -- the folks who pore over the polling data to tell us who is likely to win an election -- would likely agree. What distinguishes the law from politics or economics or math or science, they would likely argue, is that with the latter disciplines you can soak yourself in numbers, statistics, and charts. There is no mathematical equation to define the scope of the Commerce Clause, they would contend, but if you have enough raw data about early voting in a certain district you should be able to come up with a formula that tells you which candidate is more or less likely to win.</p> <p>Yes and no. I have no problem with political predictions. I can take or leave them. They give comfort to people looking for a sign. But I have little use for political predictions which are designed to have some sort of cynical impact upon the races they purport to predict. And I have even less use for people who cannot tell the difference between the two. So while I have absolutely no standing to make any political predictions about the 2012 election, and while I have no standing to evaluate the merits of this cycle's most controversial predictors, I thought the following few points were worth sharing as we near the 75-hour mark before Election Day. </p> <p><i>Dead Flies</i>. The pre-election predictions of partisans like Karl Rove and David Axelrod, or anyone else with skin in the game, aren't all put together worth two dead flies. I suppose journalists repeat these predictions so that the rest of us can look back after the election and see how wrong this people were. And I suppose that these voices are "experts" in the sense that they have personal insight into the inner workings of campaigns. But the idea that they are going to subvert their party allegiances in the name of accuracy, that they are going to be candid against self-interest, is absurd. Shut it down.</p> <p><i>Random acts</i>. No prediction, by a computer or a person, can factor into the equation all the random acts of nature and destiny that will impact voting (and an individual's vote) between now and the time the polls close on Tuesday. We all should have been harshly reminded of this immutable truth this past week with the presence (and now the aftermath) of Hurricane Sandy. It sounds silly to say, because it's so self-evident, but the election won't be determined by polling data. It will be determined by votes. People still have to vote. And vote accurately. And have their votes counted fairly.</p> <p><i>Same old story</i>. Memories are short. But the truth is, every presidential election cycle we go through some form of this nonsense. As if we don't have enough to fight about, when we are tired of fighting over the candidates, we start fighting over pollsters and pundits. Remember the great <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22188-2005Jan19.html">exit-polling scandal</a> of 2004? Remember the kerfluffle about polls in Florida<i> before</i> all those poor old ladies in Palm Beach County mistakenly voted for Patrick Buchanan? We used to fight about a single poll. Now we fight over the calculus of polling. Soon we'll be fighting about the microchips inside a voter's head.</p> <p><i>Glaciers</i>. It's worth sharing this graph from Reid Cherlin's <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/10/president-obama-appears-under-the.html">fascinating take</a> in <i>GQ</i> on the election of 2012. It's true about all elections, of course, and it's also true about the pollsters and prognosticators:</p> <blockquote><p>The problem with writing about elections is that it's difficult to prove anything until they're over. Presidential campaigns are not sprints, or even marathons. They are glaciers: huge, slow-moving, and nearly eternal, capable of moving earth but constantly fracturing and groaning under pressure. You cannot just hike out onto the ice field and know its depth or its force. You can survey the top. You can snap photos and say you went to see it, as I've done here. But you don't really know what it's doing until it recedes, and look! it created the Finger Lakes or Yosemite Valley or what have you.</p> <p>Oh, we'll say, clearly Obama was never going to be able to overcome the sluggish economy and that awful debate performance. Or we'll say, Romney was a stiff, terrible candidate with no clear agenda; the better candidate always pulls it out. The one thing we know is that we won't look back and admit to much uncertainty when it was actually happening -- even though, for most of us, the uncertainty is the story of this campaign.</p></blockquote> <p>Likewise, I see things in terms of <i>Onion</i> headlines. If Mitt Romney wins Tuesday, the headline will be: "Poor People Elect Millionaire Who Pledged To Help Rich People." And if President Barack Obama wins Tuesday, the headline will be: "Angry Whites Reelect Unpopular Black Man to Hardest Job in the World." The point is that the 2012 election narratives already are in place -- the only thing missing are the votes. You could write a lede-all for a Romney or Obama victory today, if you wanted to, and have a decent chance of being correct if you were to submit it when the votes are counted.</p> <p><i>Secrets and lies</i>. Some of the criticism of Nate Silver has been based on the fact that he does not share his secret formula by which he conjures up his predictions. I have no problem with this, except to the extent it raises many important questions: Does the formula factor in all the ugly things we now know about the inaccuracies of our vote counts? Does it discount for voter-suppression efforts which redirect registered voters to the wrong precinct? Is there a value placed on the possibility of electronic voting fraud? It's all well and good to predict the outcome of a race. It's another thing for all the valid votes in that race to be counted.</p> <p>America loves her predictions. Loves to disagree with them in advance and then dissect them afterward. Loves to praise those who got it right and ridicule those who got it wrong. That's why there are so many gainfully employed political and legal analysts and why so many people watch pregame football shows. But the truth is that the recent history of this country proves that what can go wrong in our elections does go wrong, and that there are a million -- there are 10 million -- variables which can, and which will, determine who wins on Tuesday. I don't know who is going to win. And neither does anyone else. And I'm okay with that.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252d515b/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Most+Political+Predictions+Aren%27t+Worth+2+Dead+Flies&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fmost-political-predictions-arent-worth-2-dead-flies%2F264476%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Most+Political+Predictions+Aren%27t+Worth+2+Dead+Flies&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fmost-political-predictions-arent-worth-2-dead-flies%2F264476%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658512253/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252d515b/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658512253/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252d515b/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658512253/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252d515b/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/UMmfjcKcudU" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252d515b/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cmost0Epolitical0Epredictions0Earent0Eworth0E20Edead0Eflies0C2644760C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Case for Obama and Against Liberal Despair</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/HSciwb6THlY/story01.htm</link><description>There are valid critiques of the president, but what's important now is that a vote for Obama is a vote against extremism -- and for functional government.<img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252c5f9a/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+Case+for+Obama+and+Against+Liberal+Despair&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-case-for-obama-and-against-liberal-despair%2F264465%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Case+for+Obama+and+Against+Liberal+Despair&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-case-for-obama-and-against-liberal-despair%2F264465%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2t.img" border="0"/></description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2012 20:07:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:theatlantic.com,2012-11-02:mt-264465</guid><media:category>Politics</media:category><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Reuters</media:credit><media:thumbnail url="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/obamapointbrick.thumb.reuters.jpg" /><dc:creator>Mike Lofgren</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>There are valid critiques of the president, but what's important now is that a vote for Obama is a vote against extremism -- and for functional government.</em> </p> <img alt="obamapointbrick.banner.reuters.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/obamapointbrick.banner.reuters.jpg" width="615" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div class="credit" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #242b30; margin: -3px 0 0 0; padding: 0; font-size: 9px; text-align:right ">Reuters</div> <p> <i>I think the Weimar Republic collapsed ... because there were not enough citizens. That's the lesson I have learned. Citizens cannot leave politics just to politicians.</i> <div style="text-align: right;">-- Günter Grass</div> </p><p> A number of <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/27/the_progressive_case_against_obama/">writers</a> who identify with what passes in America for a left-of-center world view say they will not vote for Barack Obama's reelection or that they would prefer that Mitt Romney become president. There seem to be three principal varieties of this attitude: <ol> <li>Obama is an unprincipled center-right politician who deceived us by campaigning as a progressive. Obama has implemented policies destructive enough to be "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/why-i-refuse-to-vote-for-barack-obama/262861/">deal breakers</a>" for principled voters. This objection focuses mainly on Obama's drone campaign, the surge in Afghanistan, indefinite detention, and his purported willingness to cut Social Security and Medicare.</li> <li>Obama, by "normalizing" bipartisan acceptance of Republican policies, may in the long-term be worse than Romney.This argument ratchets up the indictment against Obama by asserting not that Obama is insufficiently better than Romney, as the first argument usually implies, but that he may be worse. In this argument, Democrats are the key "<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/08/10/the-central-role-of-faux-republicans-in-the-anatomy-of-decline/">enablers</a>" in the process of moving the American political spectrum inexorably rightward.</li> <li>"The worse the better." I have not yet seen this argument in print, but I have heard some persons of a progressive or leftish tendency express it. They say they would prefer a Romney victory because it would administer a horse doctor's dose of emetic to a deluded electorate. By "heightening the contradictions" inherent in the American political system, a Romney victory would accelerate a crash whose pieces a reinvigorated left-populism would pick up. </li> </ol> <p>The first argument is a morally principled one, and should be treated seriously. I have also criticized Obama's national security policy, relentlessly. But there are three counterarguments that should resonate in a political environment in which Mitt Romney and the policies he espouses are the only viable alternative. </p> <p><i>First</i>, progressives are deceiving themselves if they think they have been deceived by Obama. While campaigning for his first term, Obama was careful to proclaim Afghanistan the "good" war, so as to focus on al Qaeda. So we should not delude ourselves that the surge and the drone war were undertaken in violation of a campaign pledge. And candidate Obama's high-profile vote, just before the 2008 Democratic National Convention, to indemnify the telecommunications companies for their participation in illegal surveillance, was a clear marker of what to expect. Admittedly, that does not dispose of the moral arguments about the policies themselves. (I shall discuss that later, although no doubt not to the satisfaction of the pure of heart.)</p> <p><i>Second</i>, Obama has avoided a number of potential foreign-policy disasters which a President Romney, advised by the same neoconservative foreign-policy team that misdirected President George W. Bush, has frequently declared himself eager to embark on. Despite my past criticism of Obama's Middle East policy, I believe he acquitted himself reasonably well in the way he has played Roadrunner to Benjamin Netanyahu's Wile E. Coyote. A military attack on Iran would be disastrous to all concerned, including Israel; Obama escaped getting trapped into delivering an ultimatum to Iran he would have to make good on. Romney's sudden Etch A Sketch conversion into a peacenik in the last presidential debate is not convincing, given his previous statements, the mindset of his advisers, the expectations of religious fundamentalists who constitute the greatest part of his political base, and the likely demands of Sheldon Adelson, his largest contributor (who could plausibly state that his $100 million made the difference in a tight election). </p> <p><i>Third</i>, Obama's claimed derelictions in domestic policy must be considered within the realm of the possible, meaning Congress. Try persuading Ben Nelson about the glories of single-payer health care, or Mary Landrieu that despoliation of the Louisiana Delta is not worth unlimited oil drilling, or Joe Manchin that leveling mountains to obtain coal is short-sighted. Good luck with that. Likewise with Social Security and Medicare: Obama has been open to revisions to include a gradual rise in age-eligibility or modest changes in the contribution-benefit formula. Is this heresy in view of demographics? He has also been receptive, per the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan, to raising the earnings cap on Social Security taxes (an option one would think progressives might support). Medicare is fiscally unsustainable because the entire American public-private health-care system is unsustainable. Overhaul is in order -- but does any progressive think Paul Ryan's scheme to voucherize Medicare is a solution? Does any progressive believe the privatization of Social Security à la <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/was_ryans_social_security_plan_inspired_by_pinochet/">Augusto Pinochet</a> is a better outcome than Obama's minor tweaking of a defined benefit? </p> <p>The same counterarguments apply to the second argument. It is difficult to see how Romney's announced policies would be less deleterious to the country than Obama's over any given span of time. Romney's 20-percent income tax rate cut, plus other tax cuts, would add about $6 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. His plan to increase military spending would add another $2 trillion. As a former analyst of the federal budget, I know that his claim that he could not only make these policies revenue neutral, but actually reduce the deficit, is simply eyewash intended to bamboozle low-information voters. We have 30 years of empirical evidence that tax cuts -- especially those directed at the wealthy -- neither pay for themselves nor correlate with economic growth. More likely, his scheme is a continuation of the "starve the beast" philosophy: Provoke a deficit "crisis" that can only be solved by cutting programs the GOP doesn't like -- to include Social Security and Medicare. Currently, income inequality and the ratio of CEO pay to employee pay are national scandals -- does anyone think they would improve under a Romney presidency?</p> <p>If we are to give the third argument credence, we should stock up on canned food and ammunition. "The worse the better" is a Leninist argument suitable for those wishing to overthrow a harsh authoritarian system -- and replace it with a similar one, but with themselves in charge, just as Lenin sought to replace Tsarist autocracy with Leninist totalitarianism. Very likely, though, disaffected Americans who claim to hope for a heightening of contradictions don't think with such ruthless consequentiality. No doubt most who say it do so because they think it sounds clever and mildly shocking. But attempts at self-government, imperfect and riddled with failure as history has shown them to be, demand serious adult thinking. The "lesser of two evils" political options that these people incessantly complain about are an existential fact of politics, just as many of our most important personal decisions in life boil down to choosing the lesser evil. We might as well wonder why man was born to suffer and die.</p> <p>The most compelling argument to support Obama has nothing directly to do with him or his performance in office, but goes to the heart of what self-government is supposed to mean. Since Obama's inauguration, Republicans have engaged in an unprecedented -- in my lifetime, anyway -- campaign of obstruction, feral negativity, and brinksmanship. On one occasion, they brought the country to the edge of default and a resultant credit downgrade. "The worse the better" has become, in fact, a Republican political strategy whenever they are out of power. To reward a party for such obstructionism would be like rewarding the Southern fire eaters of antebellum congresses for their efforts at shutting down the debate over slavery with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_rule">gag rule</a>. </p> In his "closing argument" speech <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-calls-79-percent-unemployment-rate-a-sad-reminder-of-economy-at-virtual-standstill/2012/11/02/fa30c6ec-24f0-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html">on November 2</a>, in West Allis, Wisconsin, candidate Romney all but threatened the country with a government shutdown and national default should Obama be re-elected, saying that only that he, Romney, could work with the congressional Republicans who pushed the country to the brink in the summer of 2011. <p>I have written <a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/12310-mike-lofgren-how-democracies-die">elsewhere</a> how the reactionary right and its rich contributors had mentally seceded from the Third French Republic and doomed it to defeat, occupation, and a sordid regime at Vichy. The parallels with some of our own <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/author/mike-lofgren/">seceding plutocracy</a> are uncomfortable. But it was the case that many French citizens of the left and center also became disaffected from the republic. If the regime is corrupt and the process is rigged, why bother participating? Many American progressives are similarly infected with a kind of facile despair to the point where they confuse half a loaf with no bread. But citizenship demands that you get your hands dirty and consent to compromises that are sometimes repellent. In 28 years on Capitol Hill, I did not see a foreign policy carried out by presidents of either party that did not have elements that were morally repugnant, fraudulent, hypocritical, or all three. Citizens must get their hands dirty nevertheless. The alternative is to cease to be a citizen and let others do the work. I am certain they would be happy to oblige.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252c5f9a/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=The+Case+for+Obama+and+Against+Liberal+Despair&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-case-for-obama-and-against-liberal-despair%2F264465%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Case+for+Obama+and+Against+Liberal+Despair&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-case-for-obama-and-against-liberal-despair%2F264465%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658526344/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c5f9a/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/HSciwb6THlY" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252c5f9a/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cthe0Ecase0Efor0Eobama0Eand0Eagainst0Eliberal0Edespair0C2644650C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Electoral Vote System Is Absurd, but It's the Law</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/fZzP9c0PjR4/story01.htm</link><description>The Giants won the World Series using the designated hitter.

(Mark Blinch/Reuters)</div> <p>Rich in history, strong in heart, the San Francisco Giants play for one of America's most lovable cities in one of America's most exquisite ballparks.</p> <p>Nonetheless, I must suggest -- no, <i>demand -- </i>that the Giants be stripped of the 2012 World Series Title.</p> <p>They cheated.</p> <p>Sort of. Well, no, not really cheated. But they were hypocrites.</p> <p>The Giants won game four of the Series on a 10th-inning run by Ryan Theriot. Theriot singled, moved to second on a sacrifice by Brandon Crawford, and romped home after Mario Scutaro singled to center field.</p> <p>What's the problem?</p> <p>Theriot was playing <i>designated hitter.</i></p> <p>The Giants are a National League team. NL players and fans (I'm one) don't believe in the designated hitter. It spoils the purity of the game. It pampers overpaid, overage hitters in the autumn of their careers. Ty Cobb would have scorned it. It's generally no good, wimpy, newfangled.</p> <p>So the Giants cannot "earn" a title by relying on the DH rule. Better luck next time, fellas -- and next time, play fair.</p> <p>Of course, technically speaking, use of the DH in the World Series is permitted by <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp"> Major League Baseball's Rule 6.10(a)(1)</a> when the game is being played in the home stadium of an American League team. Game Four was played at Comerica Park. The Giants were following the rules, and they won.</p> <p>So what? They are hypocrites, and I am sure polling results can be found somewhere to support my position that they should lose their crown. True, they might still have won with no DH rule, but they didn't, and they should lose.</p> <p>These reflections are spurred by the rumbles that the results of Tuesday's election should be determined not by the number of electoral votes (EVs) won by each candidate, but by the tally in the popular vote. In an NPR <i>Weekend Edition Saturday</i> interview with Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt, host Scott Simon <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/10/27/163760144/on-the-campaig">belabored</a> LaBolt with implied charges of hypocrisy for believing that Obama should win if he gets 270 electoral votes. In 2004, Senate candidate Obama had told a forum that the electoral-college system is "breaking down." Surely, Simon said, that means the president must believe that "people in the electoral college ought to vote for the winner of the popular vote." A few days later, a <i>Washington Post</i> poll <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/30/"><span class="s1">revealed</span></a> that the majority of its likely-voter sample believes that the winner of the popular vote should be the winner of the election.</p> <p>If there is a split between the popular vote and the electoral vote on Tuesday, we can expect to hear more of this. But no matter from which side it comes, the idea that this election should be decided after the fact on the popular vote is as silly as the idea of stripping the Giants of their Series title -- and far more dangerous.</p> <p>A couple of preliminary points. First, I would be very surprised if the popular vote and electoral vote are split. The apparent discrepancy between state and national polls, I think, is most likely an artifact of various sampling techniques. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">puts</a> the chance of a split at about 6.4 percent.</p> <p>Second, a split might benefit either Obama or Romney. According to Silver, there's a 2 percent chance Obama will win the popular vote but lose the electors, and a 4.4 chance that it will be Romney who does so: roughly two-thirds/one-third. I know which candidate I am voting for, but I am writing about this issue behind the veil of ignorance.</p> <p>Third, there is absolutely nothing bad you can say about the electoral college that I won't agree with. With the exception of the Fugitive Slave Clause, the electoral voting system is the Framers' worst handiwork. It was created largely to protect the interests of slave-owning parts of the country. It has never worked right. It first brought the country to the edge of violence in 1800. It has produced popular-vote-losing presidents four times -- 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 -- and came close to doing so in 2004. It allows obscure individuals (Quick! Can you name <i>one</i> person of any party on your home state's electoral ballot?) to apply their own whims instead of the will of their state's voters. (Electors run as "pledged" to one candidate, but can, and sometimes do, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector">vote for another</a> just because they want to.)</p> <p>Equally important, it doesn't produce any corresponding benefit. At all. My students learn in high school civics that the system "protects" the small states. But that's not true and, as Yale Professor Akhil Reed Amar demonstrated in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Constitution-Akhil-Reed-Amar/dp/0812972724/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1351861976"><i>America's Constitution: A Biography</i></a>, it has never been true. If you think the system benefits "small states," then please say hello to your fellow citizens from Vermont and Wyoming, neither one of which sees a national candidate from cycle to cycle. The system benefits a shifting set of "swing states." Some are big -- Ohio, seventh largest -- and others are small -- New Hampshire, 42nd; they are alike only in being narrowly divided in a given year. The attention they get is not only unfair, it's irrational.</p> <p>So why am I sticking up for the electoral college in 2012?</p> <p>Because it is the law.</p> <p>In fact, according to Article VI, § 2 of the Constitution, it is "the supreme Law of the Land" -- anything in the <i>Washington Post</i>-ABC News tracking poll to the contrary notwithstanding. </p> <p>Because it's the law, following it represents basic fairness at this point in the election. Each side has created a strategy aimed not at producing a popular majority but at producing 270 electoral votes. (Consider Andy Borowitz's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/borowitzreport/2012/09/poll-race-close-among-voters-with-no-television.html%22%20%5Cl%20%22ixzz2B4Ub9hTy">quip</a> that "both Obama and Romney must now spend hundreds of hours and millions of dollars to become President of Ohio.") If the popular vote determined the outcome, the candidates would both have run far different campaigns. Romney would have spent time in Texas and the Cotton South, running up red-state turnout, while Obama would have worked Illinois, California, and the Northeast, because that's where his votes are. As a result, we can't say that the popular vote Tuesday is the "will of the people." It's the result of the electoral system, and is meaningless if we treat it as anything else.</p> <p>Finally, since the electoral vote system is required by the Constitution in 2012, trying to select the president by any other means -- say, by ginning up faux outrage on cable news and partisan blogs about the inequities of the electoral vote system -- would be lawless. It is an attempted coup d'état. It puts the advantage of one party over the general stability and legitimacy of the American system of government.</p> <p>And that is true regardless of which party might benefit from a switch a few days hence.</p> <p>Is it possible that our recurring near-death experiences with the electoral college might eventually spur a bipartisan move to reform it? We can only hope so. The "college" is a loaded cannon rolling across democracy's deck. Senate candidate Barack Obama was right to question it; Scott Simon was wrong to suggest that, having once done so, he isn't allowed to win under the system we actually have.</p> <p>The DH rule should be changed too. But had it been changed before October 2012, I suspect the Giants would have found a way to win. That's why we call them the champions of the world.</p> <p>The winner of the electoral vote is also called by a technical title:</p><p>Mr. President.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252c0b27/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=The+Electoral+Vote+System+Is+Absurd%2C+but+It%27s+the+Law&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-electoral-vote-system-is-absurd-but-its-the-law%2F264467%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Electoral+Vote+System+Is+Absurd%2C+but+It%27s+the+Law&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2012%2F11%2Fthe-electoral-vote-system-is-absurd-but-its-the-law%2F264467%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658508271/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c0b27/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/148658508271/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c0b27/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/148658508271/u/49/f/625835/c/34375/s/252c0b27/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~4/fZzP9c0PjR4" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625835/s/252c0b27/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A120C110Cthe0Eelectoral0Evote0Esystem0Eis0Eabsurd0Ebut0Eits0Ethe0Elaw0C2644670C/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
